      After a 3 year hiatus, our highly anticipated new play development series
      is back! Presented in a special hybrid format, the readings are free and
      open to the public, all are accessible via digital live-stream with some
      limited in person tickets available to join live at Potrero Stage! This
      year’s line-up includes a very special virtual opening event curated by
      Sahar Assaf, the first full-read through of the recently commissioned and
      collaboratively created Triptych play by three of our Resident Artist
      playwrights, and a play by acclaimed Brooklyn-based actor and writer
      Leslie Kalarchian.
