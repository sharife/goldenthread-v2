      Thanks to your support, in 2023 we engaged over 90 artists and gave over
      4,500 audience members access to over 50 unforgettable performances!


      Since its inception, Golden Thread has been dedicated to highlighting our shared humanity and challenging negative stereotypes and misinformed narratives about the Middle East. That mission has taken on even greater urgency today.


      We recognize the continuing significance of our work as we witness the Western media blatantly dehumanize and silence Palestinian voices enduring the atrocities of war. And we are taking action by dedicating our entire 2024 season to Palestine.


      Please consider making a contribution today and join us for our 2024 Season for Palestine!

      Our annual celebration of International [Women’s Day, What Do the Women
      Say? 2024: Expressions of
      Joy](https://goldenthread.org/productions/what-do-the-women-say-2024/)
      celebrates the resilience and richness of Palestinian traditions and
      culture through the works of Palestinian women artists.

      It features Palestinian melodies sung by the **Aswat ensemble** in homage to the legacy of revered Palestinian activist, leader, and guardian of Palestinian culture and community in the Bay Area, **Nabila Mango**; an excerpt reading from *Where Can I Find Someone Like You, Ali?* a play by **Raeda Taha**; a traditional Palestinian dabke dance performance by **Al-Juthoor**; and selections from the work-in-progress musical *Mornings in Jenin*, written and composed by multidisciplinary artist [Amal Bisharat](https://goldenthread.org/productions/reorient-2023/#open-modal-Amal%20Bisharat), based on the international bestseller novel by Palestinian author **Susan Abulhawa**. The program concludes with a conversation featuring the artists facilitated by Golden Thread Executive Artistic Director **Sahar Assaf**.

      This year’s celebration features pre-show activities of traditional Palestinian food for purchase and a showcase of the art of tatreez (traditional Palestinian embroidery) from “Threads for Belonging”, curated by **Souad Amine**, a Palestinian artist based in Lebanon.
