      **Critiquing the Critics: the Reception of MENA Productions**\

      **Friday, Nov. 11th, 11:00 AM PST**


      Golden Thread invites **Sarah Fahmy**, a scholar and devising artist to moderate a conversation on the reception of MENA productions in the U.S. today with **Kareem Fahmy**, a theatre director, playwright, and screenwriter, and **Malek Najjar**, a director, playwright, and scholar of Arab American and Middle-Eastern American theatre. When Middle Eastern North African stories are constantly subjected to the white gaze and are performed in front of a predominantly white-US audience, how do MENA creative teams grapple with an authentic representation of their artistry, languages, and cultures?


      This conversation is produced and hosted by Golden Thread Productions in collaboration with the MENATMA convening taking place at the Arab American National Museum, November 10-12, 2022. 


      Register in advance for free and join us on the Zoom webinar to ask your questions directly of the panelists!
