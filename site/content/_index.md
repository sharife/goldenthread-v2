      Golden Thread is thrilled to announce the world premiere of **The Tutor**,
      a new play by our founder **Torange Yeghiazarian**, commissioned and
      produced by New Conservatory Theatre Center, and directed by
      **Sahar Assaf**, our Executive Artistic Director.

      This exciting collaboration between our companies highlights the spirit of artistic exchange and the exemplar of unifying leadership and cooperation. 


      Things are looking up for Kayvon. He’s just married Baran, a beautiful young Iranian woman, and brought her back to his Bay Area home. But when he asks his lifelong friend Azar to tutor Baran, all three lives begin to unravel as the two women fall into a passionate love affair. A study of preconceived notions and the hypocrisies that drive them, The Tutor is a provocative look at the cost of owning one’s truth.

      West Coast Premiere  



      **[11 Reflections: San Francisco](https://goldenthread.org/productions/11-reflections-san-francisco/)** is part of a new national series of performance works, **Eleven Reflections on the Nation**, devised by **Andrea Assaf**. The project draws on her seminal work, **Eleven Reflections on September**, an episodic, multimedia performance on Arab American identity, Wars on/of Terror, and “the constant, quiet rain of death / amidst beauty” in a post-9/11 world. In each participating city, the project engages local artists and community members who have been affected by post-9/11 policies to contribute their stories, illuminating our collective experiences since 2001—from the fall of the Twin Towers, to the U.S. wars on Iraq and Afghanistan, to the Muslim Ban, and now to the funding of genocide in Palestine. 


      Created and directed by **Andrea Assaf**

      Featuring acclaimed Syrian opera singer **Lubana Al Quntar**

      and Turkish composer and violinist **Eylem Basaldi**
