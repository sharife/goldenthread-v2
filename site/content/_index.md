  - subtitle: "**ReOrient Festival Returns!**"
    text: >-
      Our 2023 Season celebrates the return of our signature program, an
      innovative and spirited festival of short plays from or about the Middle
      East. 


      An endless wait in an immigration line elicits a not-so-pretty stream of consciousness. Former rivals reunite after 20 years, and a surprising twist unfolds. A comic farce of a play-within-a-play-within-a-play pushes the writer to battle over who controls the narrative. A pile of dead bodies sits untouched in the middle of an office space. A young woman sails from Armenia to Ellis Island for an inconvenient marriage. A couple negotiates at San Francisco’s hottest new Couples Therapy practice. 


      With with 6 plays selected from 113 submissions, this year’s ReOrient offers a diverse lineup of unexpected and boundary-pushing plays. Nowhere else you will see such a global mix of stories and styles on one stage in one evening!

    text: We are delighted to welcome Amal Bisharat, a Palestinian American
      multidisciplinary artist in a year-long artistic residency with the

      her first musical, a Palestinian refugee story adapted from the
      best-selling novel Mornings in Jenin by Susan Abulhawa. As a singer,
      songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist, Bisharat has been writing,
      recording, and performing with bands all her life, with songs featured on
      stage, radio, and TV. At Golden Thread, Amal will co-produce our
      2023 ReOrient Festival with Executive Artistic Director Sahar Assaf, as
