      On August 1st, 2021, ‘Theatre from the Streets’ was launched as an
      international pilot program aiming to bring forth truthful stories and
      realities of the people of Palestine, India and Venezuela to contrast
      biased political and mainstream narratives. The program continues on every
      Sunday through October 17, 2021 hosting readings of short theatre works
      from the streets to create conversations across borders with global
      audiences. No Summary invites writer and theatre critic **Mona Merhi** to
      moderate a conversation with two of the project partners, **Iman
      Aoun** the co-founder and Artistic Director of Ashtar Theatre in Ramallah,
      Palestine and **Melody Brooks,** the founder and Artistic Director of New
      Perspectives Theatre Company in New York to tell us about this
      international collaboration, what prompted them to start the project, what
      are some of their major discoveries and how they are envisioning the
      future of the program.




      ***Don't miss the Livestream on September 24th, 2021 @ 11AM PT!***
