      After a 2 year hiatus, our highly anticipated new play development series
      is back! Due to recent changes in local health and safety requirements,
      all readings are available for live-stream only. This year’s line-up
      includes a very special virtual opening event curated by Sahar Assaf, the
      first full read through of a recently commissioned and collaboratively
      created triptych play by Golden Thread Resident Artists Hassan
      Abdulrazzak, Hannah Khalil, and Mona Mansour, and a play by acclaimed
      Brooklyn-based actor and writer Leslie Kalarchian.
