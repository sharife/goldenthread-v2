    text: We're back in 2022 with daring plays that build on Golden Thread’s
      commitment to creating space for dialogue, solidarity, and innovation.
      These past two years have deprived us of the ritual of gathering together
      in a space where we experience the kind of stories that can heal the
      broken pieces of our hearts. We reclaim this ritual with stories that give
      us space to grieve our losses as well as to celebrate love and life. We
      can’t wait to return to the theatre with you, where we’ll take all the
      necessary precautions to ensure everyone’s health and safety as we share
      stories, celebrate life, and fight with love.
