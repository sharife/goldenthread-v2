      Conversations with Artists Who Don't Fit in a Box 


      Now entering its fifth consecutive year, our digital conversation series **No Summary** features conversations with theatre companies in Palestine.


      Our 2024 virtual artist conversation series embarks on a tour of four Palestinian cities to offer audiences in the Bay Area and beyond a taste of the Palestinian theatre scene today. Each episode spotlights a different theater, showcasing its history, notable performances, challenges, and life behind the scenes through interviews with its artists and community members. Theater makers, audiences, professors, and students are all invited to join in these stimulating conversations.

    text: >-
      Golden Thread continues the series of online conversations with
      Palestinian theatres this week with a spotlight on **El-Hakawati**, a
      non-profit cultural organization based in Jerusalem, Palestine. The
      National Theatre, [El Hakawati](https://el-hakawati.org/) made it its
      mission to be the theatre that acts as a cultural and artistic platform
      that provides the grounds to develop strategies and activities that
      upscale the theatrical and artistic works on the national level. The
      activities of the theatre evolved to become not only preservers of the
      Palestinian cultural heritage, but also a method to implant this
      civilizational record in the heart of the Palestinian society, add further
      achievements to it, and look for unprecedented ideas and constructive
      guidance to allow more room for Palestinian artists for experimentation
      and innovation.


      Join the conversation to learn more about El-Hakawati Theatre from **Amer Khalil**, its Director. **Kate Moore Heaney**, a NYC-based director moderates the conversation.

      West Coast Premiere  



      **[11 Reflections: San Francisco](https://goldenthread.org/productions/11-reflections-san-francisco/)** is part of a new national series of performance works, **Eleven Reflections on the Nation**, devised by **Andrea Assaf**. The project draws on her seminal work, **Eleven Reflections on September**, an episodic, multimedia performance on Arab American identity, Wars on/of Terror, and “the constant, quiet rain of death / amidst beauty” in a post-9/11 world. In each participating city, the project engages local artists and community members who have been affected by post-9/11 policies to contribute their stories, illuminating our collective experiences since 2001—from the fall of the Twin Towers, to the U.S. wars on Iraq and Afghanistan, to the Muslim Ban, and now to the funding of genocide in Palestine. 


      Created and directed by **Andrea Assaf**

      Featuring acclaimed Syrian opera singer **Lubana Al Quntar**

      and Turkish composer and violinist **Eylem Basaldi**
