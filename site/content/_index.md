      The 2024 Season for Palestine by dedicates our annual New Threads program
      to two plays by contemporary Palestinian authors. 


      August 2: Palestinian storyteller Raeda Taha’s autobiographical play ***Where can I find someone like you, Ali?*** is an epic narrative that delves into the complexities of loss, grief, and the enduring impact of political conflict. 


      August 9: ***The Return*** by Hanna Eady and Edward Mast, portraying a fateful meeting between a Palestinian and an Israeli in an auto-body shop. Both of their lives will be forever changed by the realities that surround them.

    text: >-
      West Coast Premiere  



      **[11 Reflections: San Francisco](https://goldenthread.org/productions/11-reflections-san-francisco/)** is part of a new national series of performance works, **Eleven Reflections on the Nation**, devised by **Andrea Assaf**. The project draws on her seminal work, **Eleven Reflections on September**, an episodic, multimedia performance on Arab American identity, Wars on/of Terror, and “the constant, quiet rain of death / amidst beauty” in a post-9/11 world. In each participating city, the project engages local artists and community members who have been affected by post-9/11 policies to contribute their stories, illuminating our collective experiences since 2001—from the fall of the Twin Towers, to the U.S. wars on Iraq and Afghanistan, to the Muslim Ban, and now to the funding of genocide in Palestine. 


      Created and directed by **Andrea Assaf**

      Featuring acclaimed Syrian opera singer **Lubana Al Quntar**

      and Turkish composer and violinist **Eylem Basaldi**
