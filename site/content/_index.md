      Just in time for LGBTQIA+ Pride Month, A few of our community artivists
      (artist-activists) will be having a kiki to discuss deviant theatrics!
      They'll be talking about working as SWANA Queers in various American
      theater scenes, and sharing what it takes to keep their artivists' bodies
      and minds in tune. It's all about juggling the entertainment industry of
      the Western and Eastern Hemispheres, with an LGBTQ+ spin.  Tune in to
      celebrate our Queer Artist Family!


      ***Don't miss the Livestream on June 25th, 2021 @ 11AM PT!***
