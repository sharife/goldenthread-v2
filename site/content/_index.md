      produces and performs regularly in the Bay Area. 


      “I am thrilled to welcome Wynne as my co-leader for this exciting new chapter at Golden Thread,” says Executive Artistic Director Sahar Assaf. “ As we deepen our political and social justice engagement and align our programming with our strategic plan, Wynne’s partnership is invaluable.
