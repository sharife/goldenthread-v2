    text: >-
      We’re proud to announce acclaimed Turkish-American director, writer, and
      arts leader Evren

      Odcikin as our 2024-25 Artist in Residence. This is a real homecoming for Evren who has been

      involved with Golden Thread since 2005 as an affiliated artist and staff member.


      As part of his residency, Evren will direct Adam Ashraf Elsayigh’s *ALAA: A Family Trilogy* and

      develop his new play, *ORIENTAL: 1001 Ways to Tie Yourself in Knots*. Evren also joins the

      artistic staff to help produce the culmination of the 2024 Season and launch the 2025 Season.


      “Over his two-decade career, Evren has done much for Middle Eastern artists at Golden Thread

      and beyond, so it's a real joy to be able to support his artistry with this residency,” says

      Executive Artistic Director Sahar Assaf. His artistic voice is unique, his passion for

      community engagement and brave political art is contagious, and his impact on the national

      theater field is unquestionable. What a gift to be able to benefit from his expertise and

      commitment to Golden Thread, while getting to celebrate his creativity and artistic journey.'

      West Coast Premiere  



      **[11 Reflections: San Francisco](https://goldenthread.org/productions/11-reflections-san-francisco/)** is part of a new national series of performance works, **Eleven Reflections on the Nation**, devised by **Andrea Assaf**. The project draws on her seminal work, **Eleven Reflections on September**, an episodic, multimedia performance on Arab American identity, Wars on/of Terror, and “the constant, quiet rain of death / amidst beauty” in a post-9/11 world. In each participating city, the project engages local artists and community members who have been affected by post-9/11 policies to contribute their stories, illuminating our collective experiences since 2001—from the fall of the Twin Towers, to the U.S. wars on Iraq and Afghanistan, to the Muslim Ban, and now to the funding of genocide in Palestine. 


      Created and directed by **Andrea Assaf**

      Featuring acclaimed Syrian opera singer **Lubana Al Quntar**

      and Turkish composer and violinist **Eylem Basaldi**
