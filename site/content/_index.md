    text: >-
      On November 29, 2023, Golden Thread and [Aviva
      Arts](https://www.avivaarts.org/) collaborated on a reading of [ASHTAR
      Theatre](https://www.ashtar-theatre.org/)’s [The Gaza
      Monologues](https://www.gazamonologues.com/) in observance of the
      International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People - an annual
      commemoration established by the UN aimed at raising awareness about
      Palestine and supporting justice, equality, and freedom for the
      Palestinian people.


      *The Gaza Monologues* are testimonies written by Gazan youth in 2010, after the first war on the Gaza Strip. Tragically, these monologues are still accurate today. They highlight the horrors, hopes, and resilience of the courageous Gazans, lifting up the voices of children and people in Gaza.


      The reading was presented in Arabic, English, and Farsi. To download the Gaza Monologues and read along in different languages please visit: *[The Gaza Monologues](https://www.gazamonologues.com/copy-of-team)* scripts page.

      Since its inception, Golden Thread has been dedicated to highlighting our shared humanity and challenging negative stereotypes and misinformed narratives about the Middle East. That mission has taken on even greater urgency today.


      We recognize the continuing significance of our work as we witness the Western media blatantly dehumanize and silence Palestinian voices enduring the atrocities of war. And we are taking action by dedicating our entire 2024 season to Palestine.

      Golden Thread Productions mourns the loss of innocent Palestinian and
      Israeli lives. We condemn the assault by Hamas on Israeli civilians on
      October 7th, 2023, and the ongoing and unwarranted decades-long state
      terrorism by Israel against the Palestinian civilians in the Occupied
      Palestinian Territories. We denounce antisemitism, islamophobia, racism,
      and all acts of violence and terrorism in all of its forms. We believe
      that every human life matters and every human being deserves to live a
      life of dignity.


      We call for an immediate end to the ongoing genocide and ethnic cleansing against Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip committed by Netanyahu’s government and sanctioned by Biden’s administration. We call on all people of conscience to demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and the safe release of hostages. We firmly believe that lasting peace and security in the region can only be attained through political solutions that bring an end to Israeli military occupation and state violence against Palestinians.
