    text: As we continue to witness the Zhina Mahsa Amini protests in Iran, we are
      grateful to have the chance to come together united in the community to
      celebrate two Iranian women, playwright Naghmeh Samini and director
      Torange Yeghiazarian, to tell an Iranian story about love and language,
      and stand in solidarity with the people of Iran whose fight for civil
      rights is serving us all.
