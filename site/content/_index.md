      Conversations with Artists Who Don't Fit in a Box 


      Now entering its fifth consecutive year, our digital conversation series **No Summary** will feature conversations with theatre companies in Palestine.


      Our 2024 virtual artist conversation series will embark on a tour of four Palestinian cities to offer audiences in the Bay Area and beyond a taste of the Palestinian theatre scene today. Each episode will spotlight a different theater, showcasing its history, notable performances, challenges, and life behind the scenes through interviews with its artists and community members. Theater makers, audiences, professors, and students are all invited to join in these stimulating conversations.

      Golden Thread invites multidisciplinary documentarian **Ash Marinaccio**
      to facilitate a conversation with **Iman Aoun** and **Emile Saba** of
      **ASHTAR Theatre**, of Ramallah, Palestine. ASHTAR Theatre is a non-profit
      organization that was established in 1991 in Jerusalem as the first
      theatre training organization for youth in Palestine by Edward Muallem and
      Iman Aoun, two Palestinian prominent actors who worked in theatre since
      1977. Join the conversation to learn more about ASHTAR and hear directly
      from its lead artists about making theatre under occupation and during
      times of mass atrocities and genocide.

      West Coast Premiere  



      **[11 Reflections: San Francisco](https://goldenthread.org/productions/11-reflections-san-francisco/)** is part of a new national series of performance works, **Eleven Reflections on the Nation**, devised by **Andrea Assaf**. The project draws on her seminal work, **Eleven Reflections on September**, an episodic, multimedia performance on Arab American identity, Wars on/of Terror, and “the constant, quiet rain of death / amidst beauty” in a post-9/11 world. In each participating city, the project engages local artists and community members who have been affected by post-9/11 policies to contribute their stories, illuminating our collective experiences since 2001—from the fall of the Twin Towers, to the U.S. wars on Iraq and Afghanistan, to the Muslim Ban, and now to the funding of genocide in Palestine. 


      Created and directed by **Andrea Assaf**

      Featuring acclaimed Syrian opera singer **Lubana Al Quntar**

      and Turkish composer and violinist **Eylem Basaldi**
