  - subtitle: "**Returning to Haifa**"
    text: >-
      West Coast Premiere 


      In the wake of the 1967 Six-Day War, with the borders finally open after two decades, Said and Safiyya, a Palestinian couple, return to Haifa in search of the echoes of a home they were forced to abandon during the Nakba in 1948. But are they truly ready for the encounter that awaits them upon their return? Returning to Haifa presents a deeply human portrait of two families, one Palestinian, and one Israeli Jewish, forced by history into an intimacy they didn’t choose.  


      Ghassan Kanafani was one of the most prominent Arab novelists and modernist playwrights whose pen made him a target for the Israeli Mossad, who assassinated him at the age of thirty-six years old. His novella "Returning to Haifa," one of the most important works in contemporary Palestinian literature, was first published in 1969 and was translated into various languages, including Japanese, English, Russian, and Persian.

      \

      Things are looking up for Kayvon. He’s just married Baran, a beautiful young Iranian woman, and brought her back to his Bay Area home. But when he asks his lifelong friend Azar to tutor Baran, all three lives begin to unravel as the two women fall into a passionate love affair. A study of preconceived notions and the hypocrisies that drive them, The Tutor is a provocative look at the cost of owning one’s truth. \

      West Coast Premiere  



      **[11 Reflections: San Francisco](https://goldenthread.org/productions/11-reflections-san-francisco/)** is part of a new national series of performance works, **Eleven Reflections on the Nation**, devised by **Andrea Assaf**. The project draws on her seminal work, **Eleven Reflections on September**, an episodic, multimedia performance on Arab American identity, Wars on/of Terror, and “the constant, quiet rain of death / amidst beauty” in a post-9/11 world. In each participating city, the project engages local artists and community members who have been affected by post-9/11 policies to contribute their stories, illuminating our collective experiences since 2001—from the fall of the Twin Towers, to the U.S. wars on Iraq and Afghanistan, to the Muslim Ban, and now to the funding of genocide in Palestine. 


      Created and directed by **Andrea Assaf**

      Featuring acclaimed Syrian opera singer **Lubana Al Quntar**

      and Turkish composer and violinist **Eylem Basaldi**
