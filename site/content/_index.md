      amplifying Palestinian, Armenian, and Afghan stories. Through a diverse
      collection of personal and historical narratives, we honor the strength of
      those who have endured, who are still fighting, and the voices that refuse
      to be silenced. Featuring local and national collaborations, we invite you
      to join us in community and solidarity.
