      We’re thrilled to announce beloved Bay Area administrator and artist Wynne
      Chan as Golden Thread's new Managing Director! Chan brings over a decade
      of experience in non-profit best practices and artmaking that uplifts
      historically-excluded voices.


      “I am thrilled to welcome Wynne as my co-leader for this exciting new chapter at Golden Thread," says Executive Artistic Director Sahar Assaf. "As we deepen our political and social justice engagement and align our programming with our strategic plan, Wynne’s partnership is invaluable. Her expertise in the nonprofit world, her artistic sensibilities as a director and performer, and her lived experience as a child of immigrants from Hong Kong bring a vital perspective to our community-focused mission.”
