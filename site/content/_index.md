      Our annual celebration of International [Women’s Day, What Do the Women
      Say? 2024: Expressions of
      Joy](https://goldenthread.org/productions/what-do-the-women-say-2024/)
      celebrates the resilience and richness of Palestinian traditions and
      culture through the works of Palestinian women artists.

      It features Palestinian melodies sung by the **Aswat ensemble** in homage to the legacy of revered Palestinian activist, leader, and guardian of Palestinian culture and community in the Bay Area, **Nabila Mango**; an excerpt reading from *Where Can I Find Someone Like You, Ali?* a play by **Raeda Taha**; a traditional Palestinian dabke dance performance by **Al-Juthoor**; and selections from the work-in-progress musical *Mornings in Jenin*, written and composed by multidisciplinary artist [Amal Bisharat](https://goldenthread.org/productions/reorient-2023/#open-modal-Amal%20Bisharat), based on the international bestseller novel by Palestinian author **Susan Abulhawa**. The program concludes with a conversation featuring the artists facilitated by Golden Thread Executive Artistic Director **Sahar Assaf**.

      This year’s celebration features pre-show activities of traditional Palestinian food for purchase and a showcase of the art of tatreez (traditional Palestinian embroidery) from “Threads for Belonging”, curated by **Souad Amine**, a Palestinian artist based in Lebanon.

  - subtitle: "**Returning to Haifa**"
    text: >-
      West Coast Premiere 


      In the wake of the 1967 Six-Day War, with the borders finally open after two decades, Said and Safiyya, a Palestinian couple, return to Haifa in search of the echoes of a home they were forced to abandon during the Nakba in 1948. But are they truly ready for the encounter that awaits them upon their return? Returning to Haifa presents a deeply human portrait of two families, one Palestinian, and one Jewish, forced by history into an intimacy they didn’t choose.

      Adapted for the stage by Naomi Wallace and Ismail Khalidi

      Directed by Samer Al-Saber

  - subtitle: "**11 Reflections: September**"
    text: >-
      West Coast Premiere  



      11 Reflections: San Francisco is part of a new national series of performance works, Eleven Reflections on the Nation, devised by Andrea Assaf. The project draws on her seminal work, Eleven Reflections on September, an episodic, multimedia performance on Arab American identity, Wars on/of Terror, and “the constant, quiet rain of death / amidst beauty” in a post-9/11 world. In each participating city, the project engages local artists and community members who have been affected by post-9/11 policies to contribute their stories, illuminating our collective experiences since 2001—from the fall of the Twin Towers, to the U.S. wars on Iraq and Afghanistan, to the Muslim Ban, and now to the funding of genocide in Palestine. 


      Created and directed by Andrea Assaf

      Featuring acclaimed Syrian opera singer Lubana Al Quntar

      and Turkish composer and violinist Eylem Basaldi
