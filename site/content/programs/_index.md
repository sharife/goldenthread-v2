      The ReOrient Festival of Short Plays was inaugurated in 1999 to present
      alternative perspectives of the Middle East and to showcase the
      multiplicity of stories, voices and styles from the region, and has since
      become Golden Thread’s most recognized and celebrated program.

      New Threads is Golden Thread’s annual staged reading series that engages
      its audience in the process of playmaking and allows writers of Middle
      Eastern and non-Middle Eastern descent an authentic and supportive space
      to develop work about the Middle East. Since its launch in 2011, many New
      Threads plays and playwrights have continued on to receive mainstage
      productions.

Golden Thread has been a pioneer in the field of Middle Eastern American theatre and has a long track record of producing world premieres and collaboratively developing original plays. Our programming consists of productions of new full-length plays; the [**ReOrient Festival**](https://golden-thread.netlify.com/programs/reorient/) of short plays; special community outreach events such as [**What do the Women Say?**](https://golden-thread.netlify.com/programs/what-do-the-women-say/); and the [**Fairytale Players**](/programs/fairytale-players), a dynamic touring ensemble that performs family shows at schools, libraries and festivals.

Golden Thread helped launch the careers of nationally recognized playwrights such as **Yussef el Guindi**, **Betty Shamieh**, **Denmo Ibrahim** and **Adriana Sevahn Nichols**. We have premiered over 30 full length plays investing in highly individualized development processes increasingly supported through significant contribution from community leaders. Golden Thread accepts submissions of full length plays.

Golden Thread receives play submissions from around the globe through a growing network of international artists and artistic associates. To increase the impact of our vitally important work, Golden Thread initiates and commissions play development projects. Currently, we support four [**New Play Initiatives**](/programs/new-plays): Middle East America, Kimia, Islam 101, and the [**New Threads**](https://golden-thread.netlify.com/programs/new-threads/) staged reading series.

Our work creates unique opportunities for partnership with other arts and community organizations. Golden Thread provides a link between Middle Eastern and non-Middle Eastern communities, as well as an environment in which different Middle Eastern communities may interact. Our programs expose our substantial non-Middle Eastern audience members to the genuine voices and alternative perspectives of the region, while simultaneously serving Middle Eastern audiences who rarely encounter meaningful reflections of their own culture and experience in popular media and the performing arts.
