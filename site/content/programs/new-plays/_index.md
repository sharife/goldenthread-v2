Many of the New Threads plays continue on to receive main stage productions. [**Find out more about New Threads.**](/programs/new-threads)

        Inspired by the process of alchemy, the Kimia program facilitates multi-year collaborations that explore rare themes and/or bring together unlikely creative partners. Examples include _Benedictus_ (2007), an international collaboration among Iranian, Israeli and American artists to create a play exploring the political stalemate among the three nations; _Ecstasy | a waterfable_ (2008) was a commission to Egyptian-American writer Denmo Ibrahim to create an ensemble-generated performance inspired by a Sufi fable; and _Love Missile_ (2003), an anti-war musical developed by Hal Gelb, Torange Yeghiazarian, and puppeteer Janaki Ranpura.
