          *21 Days that Change the Year* is a delightful performance frames an
          ancient tale from Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh within contemporary adventures
          of a sister and brother eagerly awaiting the coming of
          Nowruz. Starting from spring cleaning and setting a traditional
          Haft-seen table, to Charshanbeh-suri where children jump over fire,
          and the Sizdeh-bedar picnic which concludes the rite of spring
          ceremonies, *21 Days* will introduce audiences to the rituals of the
          Iranian New Year, Nowruz.

## Our 2022-23 Bay Area Schools and Libraries tour of *Nasrudin's Magnificent Journey to Samarkand* has concluded!

Our 2022-23 production was a new interpretation of a play from the **Golden Thread Fairytale Players** repertoire, ***Nasrudin’s Magnificent Journey to Samarkand***, written by Torange Yeghiazarian and directed by Sarah Al-Kassab. This visually colorful performance featuring dynamic story-telling, dance, and music, is adapted from folktales centered around the comedic personage, Nasrudin Hoja, a wise fool renowned in Central Asia, Turkey, and Iran. The performance follows Nasrudin and his faithful donkey as they travel through caravansaries in Konya, Damascus, and Isfahan where Nasrudin’s clever wisdom and propensity for exposing hypocrisy frequently get him into trouble. Will Nasrudin and his faithful donkey ever make it to Samarkand, the center of arts and crafts on the ancient Silk Road? There is only one way to find out! 

Our performances are ideal for children aged 5 - 15. The 50-minute presentation includes a 30-minute performance with audience participation, and a 20-minute Q&A with the artists. Convenient study guides and activities for grades K-5 which incorporate California Educational Standards for Performing Arts, History, Social Studies, and Language Arts are available to enhance the performance.
