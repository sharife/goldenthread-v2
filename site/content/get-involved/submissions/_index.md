Subject Line: Golden Thread Play Submission Question

Golden Thread Productions, founded in 1996, is the first theatre company in the United States focused on the Middle East. We produce passionate and provocative plays from or about the Middle East that celebrate the multiplicity of its perspectives and identities. Every play serves as an invitation to discover unexpected connections and engage in deeply moving conversations that last well beyond the life of the play. We are a developmental catalyst and vibrant artistic home to artists at various stages of their careers. We bring the Middle East to the American stage, creating treasured cultural experiences for audiences of all ages and backgrounds. [goldenthread.org](http://www.goldenthread.org)
