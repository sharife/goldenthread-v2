We are currently seeking volunteers for the **[ReOrient Festival of Short Plays](https://goldenthread.org/productions/reorient-2023/)**, with performance dates **October 13 - November 4, 2023**, at the Potrero Stage. Volunteers will help with event door monitoring, seating assistance, and general support including audience survey distribution. Our volunteers are a very important part of any successful event, and they get to see the show for free!\

Just like our artists, audiences, and staff, we ask that our volunteers wear a well-fitted mask, preferably a higher grade than cloth.

**Assist with a Production**

Production volunteers provide general assistance with productions. They may assist designers and/or technicians as they build sets, paint, hang lights, build or procure costumes and props, support rehearsals by prepping materials, including hospitality, and assist with load-in and strike, and provide administrative support such as making copies, preparing documents, or taking notes.
