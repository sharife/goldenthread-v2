**Usher an Event**

We are currently seeking volunteers for ***[What Do the Women Say? 2024: Expressions of Joy](https://goldenthread.org/productions/what-do-the-women-say-2024/)***, on Friday, March 8th!

Volunteers help with event door monitoring, seating assistance, and general support including audience survey distribution. Our volunteers are a very important part of any successful event, and they get to see the show for free!

* We ask our volunteers to **arrive 1.5 hours prior to showtime**. 
* Just like our artists, audiences, and staff, we ask that our volunteers wear a well-fitted mask, preferably a higher grade than cloth. You can read more about our health and safety protocols at [www.goldenthread.org/posts/​health-safety-protocols](http://www.goldenthread.org/posts/health-safety-protocols)

The Potrero Stage is located at 1695 18th St., San Francisco, CA 94107. Location map and transportation information is on our Plan Your Visit page [here](https://goldenthread.org/about/visit/). 

**Assist with a Production**

Production volunteers provide general assistance with productions. They may assist designers and/or technicians as they build sets, paint, hang lights, build or procure costumes and props, support rehearsals by prepping materials, including hospitality, and assist with load-in and strike, and provide administrative support such as making copies, preparing documents, or taking notes.
