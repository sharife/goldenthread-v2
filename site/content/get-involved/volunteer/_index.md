Volunteers help with event door monitoring, seating assistance, and general support including audience survey distribution. Our volunteers are a very important part of any successful event, and they get to see the show for free!

**Assist with a Production**

Production volunteers provide general assistance with productions. They may assist designers and/or technicians as they build sets, paint, hang lights, build or procure costumes and props, support rehearsals by prepping materials, including hospitality, and assist with load-in and strike, and provide administrative support such as making copies, preparing documents, or taking notes.
