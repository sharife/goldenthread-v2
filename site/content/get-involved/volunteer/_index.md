**Usher an Event**

Ushers help with event door monitoring, seating assistance, and general support including audience survey distribution, and get to see the show for free! We ask our volunteers to **arrive 1 hour prior to showtime**. 

Just like our staff, we ask that our volunteers wear a well-fitted mask, preferably a higher grade than cloth. You can read more about our health and safety protocols at [www.goldenthread.org/posts/​health-safety-protocols](http://www.goldenthread.org/posts/health-safety-protocols).
