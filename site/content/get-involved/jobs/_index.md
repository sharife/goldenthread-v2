### **Request for Proposals – Strategic Plan Consultant**

**About Golden Thread Productions:** 

Founded in 1996, Golden Thread Productions (goldenthread.org) is the first American, and San Francisco’s only theatre company devoted to plays from or about the Middle East. We define the Middle East broadly and inclusively, embracing the multiplicity of ethnic and religious identities that span Southwest Asia, North Africa, Central Asia, the Caucasus, parts of Mediterranean Europe, and our Diaspora communities. Our programs defy stereotypes and cultivate those who seek alternative perspectives of the Middle East including individuals not of Middle Eastern heritage eager to connect with cultures different than their own, as well as Middle Eastern audiences who rarely encounter meaningful reflections of their own culture and narrative in the performing arts. 

As a company created by, for, and of BIPOC artists, Golden Thread holds equity and empowerment at the core of all its operations. We intentionally recruit from MENA, BIPOC, and other under-represented communities. Our Board of Trustees is 80% Middle Eastern, our Advisory Board is 100% Middle Eastern or BIPOC, and our resident artists are mostly Middle Eastern or BIPOC. Our administrative staff fully comprises women, non-binary individuals, and half identify as BIPOC. Most employees are paid at or above industry average, and our employee culture is anchored in mutual respect, collaboration, and self-determination. 

**Organizational Context**

About the Strategic Plan 

In December 2020, Golden Thread received a substantial multi-year grant from the Hewlett foundation in order to create and implement an Adaptation Plan intended to address the company’s greatest challenges. In addition to the socio-political and environmental realities, our first-ever leadership transition, and field-wide shifts in non-profit theater, we identified deep vulnerabilities in our artists and staff. Therefore, we have devoted a portion of the grant funds to improve capacity, resiliency, and stability with operational, production, and financial models that value human resources and put artists first. One of the major goals we identified is to develop a five-year strategic plan that includes soliciting feedback from stakeholders via focus groups or one-on-one interviews and meetings, and creating a communication plan for sharing the new vision, including messaging and outreach. 

Scope of Work 

Golden Thread is looking to engage a consultant or group to lead us through a strategic planning process. This effort should focus on revising the mission, vision, and developing plans for the next 3-5 years of our company while focusing on understanding the changes in the post-COVID theater infrastructure and adapting to them for sustainability.
