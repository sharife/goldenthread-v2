**About Golden Thread Productions:** 

Founded in 1996, Golden Thread Productions (goldenthread.org) is the first American, and San Francisco’s only theatre company devoted to plays from or about the Middle East. We define the Middle East broadly and inclusively, embracing the multiplicity of ethnic and religious identities that span Southwest Asia, North Africa, Central Asia, the Caucasus, parts of Mediterranean Europe, and our Diaspora communities. Our programs defy stereotypes and cultivate those who seek alternative perspectives of the Middle East including individuals not of Middle Eastern heritage eager to connect with cultures different than their own, as well as Middle Eastern audiences who rarely encounter meaningful reflections of their own culture and narrative in the performing arts.
