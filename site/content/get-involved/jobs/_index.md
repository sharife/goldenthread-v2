**BACKGROUND** – Founded in 1996, Golden Thread Productions is the first American theatre company focused on the Middle East, defined broadly and inclusively. Golden Thread’s mission is to produce passionate and provocative plays from or about the Middle East – including its global diaspora - that celebrate the multiplicity of its perspectives and identities. We are a developmental catalyst and vibrant artistic home to artists at various stages of their careers. We bring the Middle East to the American stage, creating treasured cultural experiences for audiences of all ages and backgrounds.

For more than two decades, Golden Thread Productions has been expanding the scope of mainstream American storytelling to include Middle Eastern immigrant perspectives and advocating for diversity and inclusion in the American theatre nationally. Our programs expose non-Middle Eastern audiences to the authentic voices and alternative perspectives of the region, while serving Middle Eastern audiences who rarely encounter meaningful reflections of their own culture in the performing arts. Instilling pride, facilitating conversations and building cultural bridges among artists, audiences, and diverse communities is at the core of our artistic practice.
Golden Thread’s signature programs include the development and production of full-length plays; the ReOrient Festival of short plays; the New Threads staged reading series; an annual event featuring Middle Eastern women artists entitled What Do the Women Say?, and the Golden Thread Fairytale Players which features the creation and touring of theatre for young audiences based on Middle Eastern folktales and traditions.

**About Golden Thread Productions:** 

Founded in 1996, Golden Thread Productions (goldenthread.org) is the first American, and San Francisco’s only theatre company devoted to plays from or about the Middle East. We define the Middle East broadly and inclusively, embracing the multiplicity of ethnic and religious identities that span Southwest Asia, North Africa, Central Asia, the Caucasus, parts of Mediterranean Europe, and our Diaspora communities. Our programs defy stereotypes and cultivate those who seek alternative perspectives of the Middle East including individuals not of Middle Eastern heritage eager to connect with cultures different than their own, as well as Middle Eastern audiences who rarely encounter meaningful reflections of their own culture and narrative in the performing arts.
