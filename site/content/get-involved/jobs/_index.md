**BACKGROUND** – Founded in 1996, Golden Thread Productions is the first American theatre company devoted to plays from or about the Middle East, defined broadly and inclusively. For nearly 25 years, Golden Thread has been expanding the scope of mainstream American storytelling to include Middle-Eastern immigrant perspectives, offering opportunities for deeper dialogue about US-Middle East relations, and advocating equitable representation of voices in the American theatre nationally.
