          When a Godzilla attack interrupts the source of Shappa-Imageanna’s
          addiction to consumer goods, the prominent scientist, Dr Z and his
          newly arrived assistant Sharifa, a legal immigrant from Distancia,
          work feverishly to find alternatives. The dictator of Distancia
          rejects the generous offers made by Shappa-Imageanna’s President
          leaving him no alternative but to attack – with Love, a drug developed
          by Dr. Z and Sharifa that induces universal love. But is Love really
          all we need?
