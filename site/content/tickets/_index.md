Thank you for your interest in attending Golden Thread performances. Our ticket pricing and policies are a reflection of our commitment to provide equitable access for all. Read below for more details on our accessibility and masking policies.

## **TICKET PRICES** 

A﻿t Golden Thread, nobody is turned away for lack of funds. 

**$40 GENERAL ADMISSION**

**$80 PAY IT FORWARD** \
Attend our shows, and support our accessibility programs for audiences who need them — such as $30 under 30, Artist Access, Community Comps.

**$130 TRUE COST** \
In 2025, producing theater costs a lot of money. With every seat in the house sold, we could only break even if we sold each seat at $130. If you’re able, please consider paying the true cost of producing a show.

Are you under 30? Now, you can get $30 tickets to all performances. 

**$30 ARTIST ACCESS** \
If you are a working artist in any medium, we have $30 tickets for you!

**WALK-IN TICKETS** \
The following walk-in tickets are only available at the door and are pending availability.

* **PAY WHAT YOU WANT PREVIEWS** \
  Name your own price and be one of the first people to see our shows by attending our pre-opening performances. If you’d like to reserve tickets in advance, preview tickets are available for online purchase for as low as $20.
* **ART FOR ALL/COMMUNITY WALK-INS** \
  5% of all our seats are set aside so we can offer complimentary tickets for Community Walk-ins to ensure everyone has access to enjoy our shows. Simply show up at the door, and we’ll be delighted to offer you a seat.
* **AEA WALK-INS** \
  Pending availability, we welcome all current AEA members to redeem complimentary walk-in tickets to any show, except opening nights. We offer one seat per member.
