Thank you for your interest in attending Golden Thread performances. Our ticket pricing and policies are a reflection of our commitment to provide equitable access for all. Read below for more details on our accessibility and masking policies.



## **TICKET PRICES** 

A﻿t Golden Thread, nobody is turned away for lack of funds. 

**$40 GENERAL ADMISSION**

**$80 PAY IT FORWARD** \
Attend our shows, and support our accessibility programs for audiences who need them — such as $30 under 30, Artist Access, Community Comps.

**$130 TRUE COST** \
In 2025, producing theater costs a lot of money. With every seat in the house sold, we could only break even if we sold each seat at $130. If you’re able, please consider paying the true cost of producing a show.   

**$30 UNDER 30** \
Are you under 30? Now, you can get $30 tickets to all performances. 

**$30 ARTIST ACCESS** \
If you are a working artist in any medium, we have $30 tickets for you!

**WALK-IN TICKETS** \
The following walk-in tickets are only available at the door and are pending availability.

* **PAY WHAT YOU WANT PREVIEWS** \
  Name your own price and be one of the first people to see our shows by attending our pre-opening performances. If you’d like to reserve tickets in advance, preview tickets are available for online purchase for as low as $20.
* **ART FOR ALL/COMMUNITY WALK-INS** \
  5% of all our seats are set aside so we can offer complimentary tickets for Community Walk-ins to ensure everyone has access to enjoy our shows. Simply show up at the door, and we’ll be delighted to offer you a seat.
* **AEA WALK-INS** \
  Pending availability, we welcome all current AEA members to redeem complimentary walk-in tickets to any show, except opening nights. We offer one seat per member.

Please put a detailed note while ordering, or directly email [boxoffice@goldenthread.org](mailto:boxoffice@goldenthread.org) for any accessibility needs. Advance notification of accessibility needs helps us accommodate your party with more ease. 

Unfortunately, the venues we rent do not offer listening devices.

While we are unable to provide gender neutral restrooms in the venues we rent at this time, we embrace gender diversity and maintain an inclusive space where individual identities are respected. All are welcome to use the restroom that is most comfortable for them.
