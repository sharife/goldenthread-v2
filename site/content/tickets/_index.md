          The play dramatizes the life and career of the Pulitzer Prize-winning,
          Lebanese-American journalist Anthony Shadid during the tumultuous
          decade of 2002-2012. He is wounded in Palestine, awaits the American
          invasion of Iraq in Baghdad, covers the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in
          2006, the fall of Mubarak in Tahrir Square, and is kidnapped in Libya
          while reporting on the civil war there. As an Arabic speaker and a
          brilliant writer, he re-defined the role of a reporter and was one of
          the only correspondents who covered the lives of people from the Arab
          world from every walk of life.

          In the year 2080, the new normal involves taboos on pregnancy, car
          ownership, red meat, and suburban homes. It involves travel
          restrictions, a mixed-race majority, ongoing climate disasters, and
          constant uncertainty. But other than that, everything is the old
          normal. Except for Hoda’s experimental pregnancy. As Hoda gets
          ever-closer to her dream life – a home safe in Canada, away from
          Seattle’s floods and wildfires, and a nuclear family to settle down
          with – things don’t seem to be going as planned. As she waits for her
          husband Ahmed to adopt a child from Egypt to round out their family,
          she starts getting pains that her doctor can’t explain, and she meets
          an intriguing new friend named JeeYoung. The clock ticks as the Big
          One approaches to wash away Hoda’s plans, but she is determined to fly
          away in time. An intense yet comedic experience, this near-futuristic
          play simulates the unexpected.

          Five Muslim American women embark on an Umrah, a minor pilgrimage, to
          Mecca. Noor, an Afghan American immigrant with a secret, hopes the
          journey will give her the absolution she desperately seeks. Her tech
          CEO daughter Maryam, struggling with legal woes, sees the trip as a
          way to rebrand herself, while Noor’s nieces, the estranged sisters
          Sosan and Nadia, work to mend their fractured relationship while
          fulfilling the Umrah rituals as a requisite to receive their
          inheritance. Meanwhile, Fatima, a Black Muslim convert, hopes to find
          her biological mother. Will these five women find the spiritual
          reawakening they seek, or will secrets, rivalries, and old wounds tear
          them apart?

          An autobiographical solo show about a young woman's journey to
          retrieve and imagine a new sense of home. Through a panoply of vivid
          characters—from a five-year-old who just wants to join the
          neighborhood's Purim party to a casting director in Egypt who can't
          forget where she comes from, to her dying mother who longs for her to
          find a place in the world—Hend shares a deeply personal and true story
          about her search for the place that many of us take for granted: Home.

**GOLDEN THREAD TICKETING POLICIES**
In our continuing efforts to provide an equitable and accessible theatre experience for all, we recently revised our ticketing policies and pricing structure to better reflect three fundamental values we hold that we believe foster a just, inclusive and community-driven space.

* All artists, staff, cast, and crew deserve fair and equal compensation.
* Everyone should be able to access all available ticket prices.
* No one should be turned away for lack of funds.

We have eliminated gatekeeping practices such as exclusive access to prices via discount codes, student/senior status, or group sales and are instead offering a broader range of ticket prices designed to achieve fair wages for our artists while maintaining financial flexibility for our audiences. These include the following ticket categories:

**NAME YOUR PRICE** 
Ranging from $20 to $40, Name Your Price tickets offer a range of options, reflecting our more traditional prices. If you previously purchased $20 Thursday tickets, Student/Senior tickets, or General Admission tickets, these are for you!

**PAY IT FORWARD** 
Ranging from $50 to $100, Pay It Forward tickets are intentionally priced to support our goal of increasing access to low and no cost tickets, like our Community Walk-ins, each night, for every show. When you purchase one of these tickets, you’re contributing to greater access for all!

**PAY WHAT YOU WANT PREVIEWS**
A self-determined sliding scale, Pay What You Want tickets are available for any preview performance when you pay at the door. (Unfortunately, our box office software can’t do it in advance.) You can also purchase in advance online for only $15.

**COMMUNITY WALK-INS**
A consistent low or no cost option, Community Walk-ins are intended to ensure no one is turned away for lack of funds. 5% of all our seats are set aside each night and can be requested in advance by emailing us at boxoffice@goldenthread.org under the subject line ‘Community Walk-in’ or at the door subject to availability. 

**GENERAL BOX OFFICE INFORMATION**
For assistance with any box office related issue, please email boxoffice@goldenthread.org.

**Ticket Policies:**

* Ticket purchases are non-refundable and valid only for the date and performance issued.
* Free exchanges for a later date or a future show can be made via email subject to availability.
* All seating is general admission unless otherwise specified.
* All tickets are available for pick up at will call under the name of the purchaser.
* Online ticket sales end 4 hours before show time.
* The Box Office opens at the venue 1 hour before showtime for will call and day of show sales. 
* The house opens 30 minutes before the performance and there is no late seating. Unclaimed prepaid tickets may be released for company walk-ins prior to the start of the show.

If you have registered for a virtual event the link to access your virtual program can be found in the confirmation email for your ticket purchase. For troubleshooting tips for viewing, visit https://goldenthread.org/posts/your-guide-to-the-patron-manager-video-on-demand-platform/.

If you have registered for a free event but can no longer attend, please notify the box office so we can accommodate someone else.

**ACCESSIBILITY**

Accessibility for hearing, sight, or mobility can be addressed via email (boxoffice@goldenthread.org), phone (415-626-4061) or by putting a note in your ticket order. A request in advance of purchase or attendance will assist us in accommodating your party. Unfortunately, our venue cannot offer listening devices.

While we are unable to provide gender neutral restrooms in the venues we rent at this time, we embrace gender diversity and maintain an inclusive space where individual identities are respected. All are welcome to use the restroom that is most comfortable for them, including a private single-stall restroom available in our adjacent office, accessible via a staff member.

**COVID-19 SAFETY & PROTOCOLS** 

Golden Thread is a fully vaccinated company. All patrons must present proof of vaccination with a booster shot, along with a matching photo ID, and be masked for entry to all in-person events.

Per CDC guidance, we encourage the use of procedural masks (either alone or with a cloth mask on top) or a higher grade N95 or KN95 mask instead of cloth masks alone. Masks must be worn at all times in all areas of the theatre.

Seating will be general admission and limited to 75% capacity. Certain seats will be designated to remain empty to ensure some social distancing between parties. Advanced purchase or registration is advised.

By registering for an in-person event, you agree to adhere to our COVID-19 health and safety protocols. For more health and safety information, click [here](https://goldenthread.org/posts/health-safety-protocols/).
