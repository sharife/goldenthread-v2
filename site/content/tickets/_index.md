        text: In this last No Summary episode for 2021, our Executive Artistic
          Director **Sahar Assaf** will be in conversation with
          playwright **Adam Ashraf Elsayigh**, author of *Drowning in
          Cairo*, which will have its world premiere at Golden Thread in the
          spring of 2022. Growing up in Lebanon and Egypt respectively, Sahar
          and Adam, both advocates of documentary theatre, will engage in an
          intimate and open conversation about what made them interested in
          making theatre. The artists will talk about their theatrical journeys,
          their processes, and why *Drowning in Cairo*, a play centered on the
          lives of 3 Arab gay men, is particularly important now.
