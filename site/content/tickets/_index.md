          Written by **Adam Ashraf Elsayigh**\

          Directed by **Evren Odcikin**\

          Dramaturgy by **Salma S. Zohdi**


          In 2011, blogger Alaa Abd El-Fattah became a leading voice of the Egyptian Revolution by fusing his activism and tech acumen, inadvertently following in his famous family’s activist legacy. Since then, he has spent much of the last decade in prison, unlawfully held by a military regime seeking to silence him and his family. Weaving writings and personal testimonials from Alaa and his family matriarchs, ***ALAA: A Family Trilogy*** is an epic and ambitious dramatization of a single family’s unwavering resistance at the heart of a nation’s fight for justice. This script-in-hand workshop presentation will focus on ***Mini-Revolutionaries***, the second play in the Trilogy which follows the story of Alaa’s family from 2011 to 2014 through the Egyptian Revolution.


          Commissioned by Golden Thread Productions with support from the **Gerbode Foundation**. This presentation is part of the **Z Space Technical Residency Program**.

**GOLDEN THREAD TICKETING POLICIES**
Thank you for your interest in purchasing tickets! Our ticket pricing is a reflection of our continuing efforts to provide an equitable and accessible theatre experience for all. It is  driven by three fundamental values we hold that we believe foster a just, inclusive and community-driven space. 

* All artists, staff, cast, and crew deserve fair and equal compensation.
* Everyone should have access to a ticket price they find affordable. 
* No one should be turned away for lack of funds.

We offer a range of ticket prices designed to maintain financial flexibility for our audiences and financial stability for our artists. These price ranges include: 

**NAME YOUR PRICE** \
Starting at $25, or $30 for our mainstage shows, **Name Your Price** tickets offer the flexibility to pay more or less with multiple price points at $50 and under. 

**PAY IT FORWARD** \
Starting at $55, or $60 for our mainstage shows, **Pay It Forward** tickets are intentionally set at multiple price points up to $100 to support access to low-to-no cost tickets, like our Community Walk-ins. 

**PAY WHAT YOU WANT PREVIEWS**\
A self-determined sliding scale, **Pay What You Want** tickets are available at-the-door for any preview performance of a main stage show. Preview tickets can also be purchased in advance online for $20. 

**COMMUNITY WALK-INS**\
5% of all our seats are available for **Community Walk-ins** to ensure no one is turned away for lack of funds. They may be requested at-the-door or in advance by emailing us at [boxoffice@goldenthread.org](mailto:boxoffice@goldenthread.org).  We offer one seat per request, but may accommodate one additional guest when possible. In your email, please leave your name, your preferred show date and if you are requesting one or two tickets.

**AEA WALK-INS** \
We welcome all current AEA members to redeem complimentary walk-in tickets to any main stage show, except opening night, pending availability. You may email ahead of time to check availability, but there is no need to contact us in advance as all walk-ins are based solely on availability. We offer one seat per member, but may accommodate one additional guest when possible.

**COVID-19 SAFETY & PROTOCOLS** 

Golden Thread is a fully vaccinated company. Our health and safety protocols comply with current health and safety guidelines provided by the State of California and City of San Francisco. These policies will be updated if city guidelines change. 

For the safety of our artists and fellow audience members, **we strongly recommend all guests to wear well-fitted masks while inside the theater.** Per CDC guidance, we encourage the use of procedural masks (either alone or with a cloth mask on top) or a higher grade N95 or KN95 mask instead of cloth masks alone.  

At performances where concessions are served, we strongly recommend guests resume masking when not actively eating or drinking. The ability to take concessions into the theater will vary depending on the venue. 

By registering for an in-person event, you agree to adhere to our COVID-19 health and safety protocols. For more health and safety information, click [here](https://goldenthread.org/posts/health-safety-protocols/).
