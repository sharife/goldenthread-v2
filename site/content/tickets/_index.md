          priority. In response to health and safety developments related to the
          recent surge of COVID infections in the Bay Area and revised
          recommendations from city and county health departments along with the
          CDC, Golden Thread has made the decision to present our New Threads

          our updated Zoom event. We look forward to rejoining you in person at
          Potrero Stage as soon as is safely possible, and can’t wait to share
          these vital new plays-in-progress with you virtually!
