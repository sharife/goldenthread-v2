          On August 4, 2020, at 6:07 PM one of the biggest non-nuclear
          explosions in the history of mankind happened at the port of Beirut,
          Lebanon. This catastrophic event claimed the lives of more than 200
          victims, injured 7000 and left 300,000 homeless and caused massive
          property damage across the city. Golden Thread Productions
          collaborates with Al Madina Theatre and the Legal Agenda in Lebanon to
          present ***I Want to Tell You About Beirut***, which commemorates the
          1-year mark of the explosion that ruined the lives of thousands of
          innocent civilians. The event will commence with a recorded reading of
          testimonies presented in English and Arabic by actors based in San
          Francisco and actors based in Beirut and will be followed by a live
          roundtable discussion featuring Sahar Assaf (Executive Artistic
          Director, Golden Thread Productions), Nidal Alashkar (Artistic
          Director, Al Madina Theatre), Zeina Daccache (Executive Director,
          Catharsis - Lebanese Center for Drama Therapy), Ghida Frangieh
          (Lawyer, Legal Agenda), Tania El Khoury (Performance Artist), and
          Hamid Sinno (Musician and Writer).


          *This event is livestreamed. It will be accessible for English and Arabic speaking audiences and will last for approximately 90 minutes.*


          *Space is limited so reservations are recommended.*
