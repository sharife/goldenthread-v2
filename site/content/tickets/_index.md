          Our 2024 virtual artist conversation series will embark on a tour of
          four Palestinian cities to offer audiences in the Bay Area and beyond
          a taste of the Palestinian theatre scene today. Each episode will
          spotlight a different theater, showcasing its history, notable
          performances, challenges, and life behind the scenes through
          interviews with its artists and community members. Theater makers,
          audiences, professors, and students are all invited to join in these
          stimulating conversations.

          Created and directed by **Andrea Assaf** \

          Featuring acclaimed Syrian opera singer **Lubana Al Quntar**  \

          and Turkish composer and violinist **Eylem Basaldi** 


          ***11 Reflections: San Francisco*** is part of a new national series of performance works, [Eleven Reflections on the Nation](https://www.art2action.org/eleven-reflections), devised by **Andrea Assaf**. The project draws on her seminal work, ***Eleven Reflections on September***, an episodic, multimedia performance on Arab American identity, Wars on/of Terror, and “the constant, quiet rain of death / amidst beauty” in a post-9/11 world. In each participating city, the project engages local artists and community members who have been affected by post-9/11 policies to contribute their stories, illuminating our collective experiences since 2001—from the fall of the Twin Towers, to the U.S. wars on Iraq and Afghanistan, to the Muslim Ban, to the funding of genocide in Palestine.  


          Co-produced by **Golden Thread Productions**, **Brava for Women in the Arts**, **Art2Action**, and in collaboration with **Aviva Arts**  \

          \

**GOLDEN THREAD TICKETING POLICIES**
Thank you for your interest in purchasing tickets! Our ticket pricing is a reflection of our continuing efforts to provide an equitable and accessible theatre experience for all. It is  driven by three fundamental values we hold that we believe foster a just, inclusive and community-driven space. 

* All artists, staff, cast, and crew deserve fair and equal compensation.
* Everyone should have access to a ticket price they find affordable. 
* No one should be turned away for lack of funds.

We offer a range of ticket prices designed to maintain financial flexibility for our audiences and financial stability for our artists. These price ranges include: 

**NAME YOUR PRICE** \
Starting at $25, or $30 for our mainstage shows, **Name Your Price** tickets offer the flexibility to pay more or less with multiple price points at $50 and under. 

**PAY IT FORWARD** \
Starting at $55, or $60 for our mainstage shows, **Pay It Forward** tickets are intentionally set at multiple price points up to $100 to support access to low-to-no cost tickets, like our Community Walk-ins. 

**PAY WHAT YOU WANT PREVIEWS**\
A self-determined sliding scale, **Pay What You Want** tickets are available at-the-door for any preview performance of a main stage show. Preview tickets can also be purchased in advance online for $20. 

**COMMUNITY WALK-INS**\
5% of all our seats are available for **Community Walk-ins** to ensure no one is turned away for lack of funds. They may be requested at-the-door or in advance by emailing us at [boxoffice@goldenthread.org](mailto:boxoffice@goldenthread.org).  We offer one seat per request, but may accommodate one additional guest when possible. In your email, please leave your name, your preferred show date and if you are requesting one or two tickets.

**AEA WALK-INS** \
We welcome all current AEA members to redeem complimentary walk-in tickets to any main stage show, except opening night, pending availability. You may email ahead of time to check availability, but there is no need to contact us in advance as all walk-ins are based solely on availability. We offer one seat per member, but may accommodate one additional guest when possible.

Accessibility for hearing, sight, or mobility can be addressed via email (boxoffice@goldenthread.org), phone (415-626-4061) or by putting a note in your ticket order. A request in advance of purchase or attendance will assist us in accommodating your party. Unfortunately, our venue cannot offer listening devices.

While we are unable to provide gender neutral restrooms in the venues we rent at this time, we embrace gender diversity and maintain an inclusive space where individual identities are respected. All are welcome to use the restroom that is most comfortable for them, including a private single-stall restroom available in our adjacent office, accessible via a staff member.

**COVID-19 SAFETY & PROTOCOLS** 

Golden Thread is a fully vaccinated company. Our health and safety protocols comply with current health and safety guidelines provided by the State of California and City of San Francisco. These policies will be updated if city guidelines change. 

For the safety of our artists and fellow audience members, **we strongly recommend all guests to wear well-fitted masks while inside the theater.** Per CDC guidance, we encourage the use of procedural masks (either alone or with a cloth mask on top) or a higher grade N95 or KN95 mask instead of cloth masks alone.  

At performances where concessions are served, we strongly recommend guests resume masking when not actively eating or drinking. The ability to take concessions into the theater will vary depending on the venue. 

By registering for an in-person event, you agree to adhere to our COVID-19 health and safety protocols. For more health and safety information, click [here](https://goldenthread.org/posts/health-safety-protocols/).
