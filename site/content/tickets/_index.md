          It will feature Palestinian melodies sung by the Aswat ensemble in an homage to the legacy of revered Palestinian activist, leader, and guardian of Palestinian culture and community in the Bay Area, **Nabila Mango**; an excerpt reading from *Where Can I Find Someone Like You, Ali?* a play by **Raeda Taha**; a traditional Palestinian dabke dance performance by **Al-Juthoor**, a Palestinian Levantine Arab dabke troupe in the SF Bay Area; and a selection of material from the musical *Mornings in Jenin*, a work-in-progress written and composed by multidisciplinary artist **Amal Bisharat**, based on the international bestseller novel by Palestinian renowned author **Susan Abulhawa**. The program concludes with a conversation featuring the artists facilitated by Golden Thread Executive Artistic Director **Sahar Assaf**. 


          This year’s celebration will also offer traditional Palestinian food for purchase and a showcase of the art of tatreez (traditional Palestinian embroidery) from “Threads for Belonging”, curated by **Souad Amine**, a Palestinian artist based in Lebanon, starting at 6:30 pm in the lobby before the show.

          By **Ghassan Kanafani**\

          Adapted for the stage by **Naomi Wallace** and **Ismail Khalidi**\

          Created and directed by **Andrea Assaf** \

          Featuring acclaimed Syrian opera singer **Lubana Al Quntar**  \

          and Turkish composer and violinist **Eylem Basaldi** 


          ***11Reflections: San Francisco*** is part of a new national series of performance works, [Eleven Reflections on the Nation](https://www.art2action.org/eleven-reflections), devised by **Andrea Assaf**. The project draws on her seminal work, Eleven Reflections on September, an episodic, multimedia performance on Arab American identity, Wars on/of Terror, and “the constant, quiet rain of death / amidst beauty” in a post-9/11 world. In each participating city, the project engages local artists and community members who have been affected by post-9/11 policies to contribute their stories, illuminating our collective experiences since 2001—from the fall of the Twin Towers, to the U.S. wars on Iraq and Afghanistan, to the Muslim Ban, to the funding of genocide in Palestine.  


          Co-produced by **Golden Thread Productions**, **Brava for Women in the Arts**, and **Art2Action** and in collaboration with **Aviva Arts**  \
