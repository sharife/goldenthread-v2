[](https://www.goldenthread.org)**Golden Thread Productions**, in collaboration with **Humanitas Media**, is proud to announce a new international commission with acclaimed playwright **Abhishek Majumdar**. The commission will develop a groundbreaking new play inspired by the real-life story of a man imprisoned for eight years at Guantánamo Bay, adapted from detailed accounts originally written by his lawyer, **Joshua Colangelo-Bryan**.

Drawing on interviews with a wide range of voices connected to Guantánamo, ***The 11 Lives of Jaber Mohammad*** (working title) based on Joshua Colangelo-Bryan's book, *[Through the Gates of Hell: American Injustice at Guantánamo Bay](https://humanitasmedia.org/human-rights-books/)*, will weave together a mosaic of perspectives spanning Cuba, the United States, Bahrain, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Saudi Arabia. Through this lens, Majumdar seeks to illuminate the human, political, and moral dimensions of one of the most complex and haunting sites of contemporary history.

Reflecting on the story and inspiration, playwright Majumdar writes, “In 2004, attorney Joshua Colangelo-Bryan arrived at Guantanamo Bay to meet Jaber Mohammed (a pseudonym), one of six Bahraini detainees his firm had agreed to represent. Colangelo-Bryan had heard these men were “among the most dangerous, best-trained, vicious killers on the face of the earth,” as Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld put it. Colangelo-Bryan didn’t buy the rhetoric, but did find himself wondering if he was about to meet a killer. Far from being threatening, though, Mohammed welcomed Colangelo-Bryan, even as his ankle was shackled to the floor. Why was Mohammed there? Was he guilty of a crime? These were among the questions Colangelo-Bryan had to answer. Surprisingly, the two spoke for hours about their lives. Mohammed also detailed the inhumane conditions at the prison, including abuse by guards and solitary confinement. What developed was a friendship that has stood the test of time, leading to Jaber being freed from Guantanamo and Joshua discovering greater purpose in life. The play is based on this book and interviews of detainees, prison guards, lawyers, judges, doctors, soldiers, philosophers of law, Islamic scholars and historians, asking questions about the rights of the human body in the era of the American Superpower and the ethics of the ‘war on terror’.” 

This new commission is made possible through the generous gift from **Tracy Aanenson**, founder of [Humanitas Media](https://humanitasmedia.org/), a new nonprofit organization dedicated to amplifying stories that illuminate human rights and social justice. Humanitas ​Media published Colangelo-Bryan’s book, *[Through the Gates of Hell: American Injustice at Guantánamo Bay](https://humanitasmedia.org/human-rights-books/)*,​ on which this project is based.​ 

“Humanitas Media exists to champion stories that stir empathy and challenge injustice,” states Humanitas Media founder Tracy Aanenson. “We are proud to partner with Abhishek Majumdar and Golden Thread Productions on a work that conveys the profound power of art and advocacy to inspire change.”

“This commission represents exactly what Golden Thread stands for: courageous storytelling that crosses borders, interrogates systems of power, and centers our shared humanity,” said Sahar Assaf, outgoing Artistic Director of Golden Thread on her final commission for the company. She added, “We are deeply grateful to Tracy Aanenson and Humanitas Media for recognizing the urgency of this work and helping us bring it to life.”

“I’m honored to steward this impactful commission forward in collaboration with our artists and partners,”  said Nabra Nelson, newly appointed Artistic Director of Golden Thread. She added, “Golden Thread is committed to ensuring it reaches audiences with the care, ambition, and integrity it deserves.”

Golden Thread plans to develop the play through a multi-year process leading toward a world premiere. The play’s development will be guided by dramaturg **Jocelyn Clarke**, with a residency at Field Arts & Events Hall in Port Angeles, Washington. This partnership will offer the creative team space and resources to experiment, exchange ideas, and shape the work through an intensive collaborative process across disciplines and geographies.
