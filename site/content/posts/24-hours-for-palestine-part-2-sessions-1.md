## SCHEDULE

### Saturday, September 27, 2025

* ***S﻿ESSION 1 (LIVE): 10:00 AM Pacific | 1:00 PM Eastern | 8:00 PM Palestine***\
  **Opening: Homage to Refaat Alareer featuring Mosab Abu Toha and Readings from *Gaza Writes Back***\
  The Artistic Directors of Golden Thread Productions and Art2Action, Sahar Assaf and Andrea Assaf, open the 24-hour livestream, with special guest, Pulitzer Prize winning poet Mosab Abu Toha. We honor the legacy of his close friend, Palestinian writer and poet Refaat Alareer, martyred on December 6, 2023,  through readings from *Gaza Writes Back*, the short story anthology Refaat edited and published in 2013. The anthology amplifies the voices of young Palestinians who survived the 2008-09 Israeli assault on Gaza, known as Operation Cast Lead. Through short stories and testimonies, these writers bear witness to daily life under siege and bombardment, transforming personal memory into acts of resistance and resilience. Mosab will also offer reflections on Refaat’s life, his work, and the ongoing situation in Gaza.\

We follow sole survivors of the genocide in Gaza, their struggles and physiological wounds after losing their entire families.\
  **Presenter:** Inès Abdel Razek (Co-Director, PIPD)  
* ***S﻿ESSION 3 (HYBRID): 12:00 PM Pacific | 3:00 PM Eastern | 10:00 PM Palestine***\
  **Staged Reading of *Gitmo Lab* by Hanna Eady**\
  Dunya Productions presents a staged reading of Hanna Eady's new short play Gitmo Lab, set at Guantanamo Bay prison. With thematic and structural resonances to Dunya's upcoming Fall mainstage production Almonds Blossom in Deir Yassin, this staged reading tackles new perspectives, exploring the theme of the "smuggling of life" through the voice of playwright and founding company member Hanna Eady. Performed as a cold reading (with no prior rehearsal) by Seattle actors Yusef, Rayan, and Nabra. \
  **Performers:** Nabra Nelson, Rayan, and Yusef 
* ***S﻿ESSION 4 (LIVE): 1:00 PM Pacific | 4:00 PM Eastern | 11:00 PM Palestine*** \
  **Palestinian Artists in Lebanon**\
  This conversation with five gifted actors, directors, playwrights, filmmakers, journalists and activists, all based in Beirut, is an opportunity to learn how Palestinian creators are contributing to the arts and culture of Lebanon, and how they are navigating the challenges they face in telling their stories.\
  **Moderator:** Catherine Coray (Arts Professor, NYU; Affiliate Producer, Noor Theatre)\
  **Speakers/performers:** Omar Ahmad, Naila Al Hares, Awad Awad, Aliya Khalidi, Rana Zeidan

  ***Severed*: Because Palestine is a Disability Justice Issue (Donkeysaddle Projects)**\
  *Severed* is a new short documentary that follows the story of Mohamad Saleh, a Palestinian teenager from Gaza who lost his leg at only 12 years old and has survived five Israeli military assaults. Mohamad’s story is both deeply personal, and  a reflection of the thousands of people disabled by Israel’s ongoing genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. This screening is part of a larger grassroots campaign to center Palestinian voices, deepen understanding of the genocide through a disability justice lens, and build solidarity between Palestinians and the larger disability justice community. \
  **Moderator:** Kat Anaza (Outreach Associate, Donkeysaddle Projects)\
  **Speakers/performers:** Mohammed Mhawish, Dom Kelly
* ***S﻿ESSION 6 (LIVE): 3:00 PM Pacific | 6:00 PM Eastern | 1:00 AM Palestine (Sunday, Sept 28)***\
  ***Tennis in Nablus*: Reading & Conversation with Playwright Ismail Khalidi**\
  Join us for a presentation of selected scenes from *Tennis in Nablus*, a “tragipoliticomedy” by acclaimed Palestinian-American playwright Ismail Khalidi. The play skillfully blends humor and pathos to explore the complexities of Palestinian history, human struggle, and political themes. *Tennis in Nablus* was nominated for a Suzi Bass Award and won the Kennedy Center Quest for Peace Award, and Khalidi’s work is celebrated for its sharp political insight and the way it uses comedy to illuminate the human condition. Following the performance, Khalidi will join the performers for a discussion of the play.\

  ***Do you see me?* A Photopoem in the Haunting Voice of Starving Children in Gaza** \
  *Do You See Me?* is a searing 17-minute photopoem/video built from still, raw, unflinching images of starved children in Gaza — their hunger, their frailty, their state of mind and health — forcing us to confront why this is happening to them. Layered with the urgent, piercing voices of two children and carried by Oud and haunting music, the piece fuses testimony, poetry, and sound into an act of witness that refuses silence. It exposes starvation as a weapon of genocide and insists that, for a few minutes, we do not look away. In Gaza, parents never look away from their children — and neither should we. The screening of *Do You See Me?* will be followed by remarks from Dr. Ahmad Alfarra, head of the pediatric division at Al Nasser Medical Center in Khan Younis, Gaza. Dr. Alfarra will speak about the cases of malnutrition and forced starvation he is witnessing, and deliver an urgent message for all who are listening. \
  **Moderator:** Mo Sati (Writer, Poet, Playwright, Digital Creator)\
  **Speaker:** Dr. Ahmad Al Farra (Pediatrician and Chair of the Children’s Department, Al Nasser Hospital, Gaza, Palestine)
