  **O﻿PENING: HOMAGE TO REFAAT ALAREER FEATURING MOSAB ABU TOHA AND READINGS FROM *GAZA WRITES BACK***\
  The Artistic Directors of Golden Thread Productions and Art2Action, Sahar Assaf and Andrea Assaf, open the 24-hour livestream, with special guest, Pulitzer Prize winning poet Mosab Abu Toha. We honor the legacy of his close friend, Palestinian writer and poet Refaat Alareer, martyred on December 6, 2023,  through readings from *Gaza Writes Back*, the short story anthology Refaat edited and published in 2013. The anthology amplifies the voices of young Palestinians who survived the 2008-09 Israeli assault on Gaza, known as Operation Cast Lead. Through short stories and testimonies, these writers bear witness to daily life under siege and bombardment, transforming personal memory into acts of resistance and resilience. Mosab will also offer reflections on Refaat’s life, his work, and the ongoing situation in Gaza.\

  Dunya Productions presents a staged reading of Hanna Eady's new short play Gitmo Lab, set at Guantanamo Bay prison. With thematic and structural resonances to Dunya's upcoming Fall mainstage production Almonds Blossom in Deir Yassin, this staged reading tackles new perspectives, exploring the theme of the "smuggling of life" through the voice of playwright and founding company member Hanna Eady. Performed as a cold reading (with no prior rehearsal) by Seattle actors Yusef, Rayan, and Nabra. \

  *Severed* is a new short documentary that follows the story of Mohamad Saleh, a Palestinian teenager from Gaza who lost his leg at only 12 years old and has survived five Israeli military assaults. Mohamad’s story is both deeply personal, and  a reflection of the thousands of people disabled by Israel’s ongoing genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. This screening is part of a larger grassroots campaign to center Palestinian voices, deepen understanding of the genocide through a disability justice lens, and build solidarity between Palestinians and the larger disability justice community. \

  Join us for a presentation of selected scenes from *Tennis in Nablus*, a “tragipoliticomedy” by acclaimed Palestinian-American playwright Ismail Khalidi. The play skillfully blends humor and pathos to explore the complexities of Palestinian history, human struggle, and political themes. *Tennis in Nablus* was nominated for a Suzi Bass Award and won the Kennedy Center Quest for Peace Award, and Khalidi’s work is celebrated for its sharp political insight and the way it uses comedy to illuminate the human condition. Following the performance, Khalidi will join the performers for a discussion of the play.\

  ***DO YOU SEE ME? A PHOTOPOEM IN THE HAUNTING VOICE OF STARVING CHILDREN IN GAZA***\
  *Do You See Me?* is a searing 17-minute photopoem/video built from still, raw, unflinching images of starved children in Gaza — their hunger, their frailty, their state of mind and health — forcing us to confront why this is happening to them. Layered with the urgent, piercing voices of two children and carried by Oud and haunting music, the piece fuses testimony, poetry, and sound into an act of witness that refuses silence. It exposes starvation as a weapon of genocide and insists that, for a few minutes, we do not look away. In Gaza, parents never look away from their children — and neither should we. The screening of *Do You See Me?* will be followed by remarks from Dr. Ahmad Alfarra, head of the pediatric division at Al Nasser Medical Center in Khan Younis, Gaza. Dr. Alfarra will speak about the cases of malnutrition and forced starvation he is witnessing, and deliver an urgent message for all who are listening. \
  **Moderator:** Mo Sati (Writer, Poet, Playwright, Digital Creator)\
  **Speaker:** Dr. Ahmad Al Farra (Pediatrician and Chair of the Children’s Department, Al Nasser Hospital, Gaza, Palestine)

  ***7:00 PM Pacific | 10:00 PM Eastern | 5:00 AM Palestine (Sun, Sep 28)***\
  ***G﻿OING BACK HOME...* STORIES FROM MY DIARY**\
  After 26 years away, I finally returned to my precious homeland — to my people, my family, and to the land that I love. I was stunned by the changes: endless checkpoints, hours-long detours for 15 minute drives, restrictions on Muslims praying at Al-Aqsa, among so many other dehumanizing things. I don’t typically turn away from injustice — I try to help, speak up, or at least document it. During my visit, I wrote (and took video/pictures) about several powerful moments in my diary — experiences that shook me, moved me, and reminded me why home, Falasteen, and the fight for its liberation is imperative in all we do.\

  **F﻿ROM GAZA: AHMED MUIN OF GAZA BIRDS SINGING**\
  On Friday, September 26, 2025, Soline Daccashe and Sahar Assaf sat down over Zoom with Ahmed Muin (also known as Abu Amsha) — a guitarist, composer, music teacher, and community builder from Gaza. The world first came to know his work through a viral video in which he transformed the sound of drones into music, a haunting testament to Palestinian creativity even under genocide. In this conversation, Ahmed spoke of being displaced fifteen times, of the children who followed him from camp to camp, of his enduring love for Gaza and his home, and of the unbreakable bond between art and life amid devastation. He closed with a powerful appeal for what he hopes the world will do in solidarity with his people.\
  **Moderators:** Soline Daccashe & Sahar Assaf\
  **Speaker:** Ahmed Muin
* ***Se﻿ssion 17 (Pre-recorded)***\
  ***2:00 AM Pacific | 5:00 AM Eastern | 12:00 PM Palestine***\
  ***L﻿ETTERS FROM THE GROUND* – ZOUKAK THEATRE COLLECTIVE**\
  This session consists of a reading of letters – *Letters from the Ground*. In our region, we have lived under aggression and existential threats for decades. From Lebanon, from Zoukak Theatre, we launch a series of letters that emerge from the present moment. Each addresses a specific audience, sharing what deeply troubles us. Through these letters, we attempt to pierce the slogans that obscure reality, to breathe beneath the rubble, and dust off the grime of war and fabricated news. We send them as messages — like the smile of a Palestinian beneath the feet of soldiers.\
  **Presenters:** Zoukak Theatre Collective: Mohamad Hamdan (Mathematician, Theatre Practitioner, Trainer in Nonviolent Communication), Maya Zbib (Theatre Director, Performer, Writer, Trainer), Junaid Sarieddeen (Theatre Director, Actor, Dramaturg)\
  **Note:** To read the letters, visit [https://livestay-zoukaktheatre.blogspot.com](https://livestay-zoukaktheatre.blogspot.com/)

  **E﻿NVISIONING FUTURES, CREATING FREEDOM: ASHTAR THEATRE'S PERFORMING ARTS VILLAGE AND ACADEMY**\
  ASHTAR Theatre joins 24 Hours for Palestine with a conversation from Ramallah on the current situation, the role of art in resistance and resilience, and the vision for and the development of a new Performing Arts Village and Academy in Birzeit, Palestine. The session will also premiere a short documentary from the August 2024 pilot program, where Palestinian youth explored an innovative curriculum integrating theatre and circus. Together, ASHTAR’s leaders and young artists share how creativity becomes a force for survival, resilience, solidarity, liberation, and how to support them.\
  **Moderators:** Marina Johnson\
  **Speakers:** Iman Aoun and Emile Saba
* ***Se﻿ssion 19 (Pre-recorded)***\
  ***4:00 AM Pacific | 7:00 AM Eastern | 2:00 PM Palestine***\
  **THE INSIDIOUSNESS OF LANGUAGE**\
  This conversation explores the insidiousness of language in shaping narratives about Palestine. From media framing to political rhetoric, the words we use can obscure histories, dehumanize communities, and normalize injustice. Together, artists and writers will reflect on how language — whether unexamined or deliberately manipulated — can reinforce systems of power, including settler colonialism, and how it misleads through exaggeration, omission, and distortion. Rather than a legal or policy analysis, this discussion will center artistic and personal perspectives, drawing on storytelling, poetry, and lived experience. Panelists will consider how assumptions and “givens” are constructed, why we must actively unlearn them, and what is at stake in naming and framing. The conversation will highlight how artists, writers, and activists are reclaiming language to tell fuller, more truthful stories.\
  **Moderator:** Amal Bisharat (Co-founder / Artistic Director, Meem Collective)\
  **Speakers:** Farrah Hamzeh (Artist), Rolla Selbak (Filmmaker, Podcaster, Storyteller), and Priscilla Wathington (Poet & Human Rights Advocate)
* ***Se﻿ssion 20 (Hybrid)***\
  ***5:00 AM Pacific | 8:00 AM Eastern | 3:00 PM Palestine***\
  **N﻿EW THEATRE WORKS FOR PALESTINE**\
  This session features excerpts of new theatre works in a range of genres, by Palestinian and Palestinian American artists, as well as Jewish American allies who are making theatre in alignment with their activism for Palestinian liberation. Readings and video excerpts of new works will be followed by a conversation among the artists. Questions we’ll explore include: What is the relationship between theatre and activism in these times? How can humor, satire, and camp be creative tools in our movements for justice? What does embodied solidarity look like, and what is the significance of the body in liberation work? And more.\
  **Moderator:** Andrea Assaf
* ***Se﻿ssion 21 (Live)***\
  ***6:00 AM Pacific | 9:00 AM Eastern | 4:00 PM Palestine***\
  **TO REMAIN HUMAN: WRITING THROUGH GENOCIDE WITH MAHRU ELAHI & MICAELA KAIBNI RAEN**\
  We must recover our own well of resistance, for, as novelist Isabella Hammad states in *Recognizing the Stranger: On Palestine and Narrative*, “To remain human at this juncture is to remain in agony. Let us remain there: it is the more honest place from which to speak.” Using the voices of Palestinian writers and allies, we’ll consider how to craft visions of the past, present and future that de-center the West and embrace our enduring and persistent humanity. We’ll engage in close readings of model texts and make-meaning together, as well as have an opportunity to write based on several generative prompts suitable for any genre.\
  **Facilitators:** Mahru Elahi and Micaela Kaibni Raen
* ***Se﻿ssion 22 (Live)***\
  ***7:00 AM Pacific | 10:00 AM Eastern | 5:00 PM Palestine***\
  **C﻿ULTURE, RESISTANCE, AND BOYCOTT: WHY ART MATTERS IN THE STRUGGLE FOR PALESTINE**\
  In times of genocide, culture is never neutral. While oppressive systems use art and cultural institutions to normalize injustice — a strategy known as cultural washing–artists have long turned to storytelling, music, theatre, and film as essential tools of resistance. This panel explores the importance of the cultural boycott within the broader BDS movement, the mechanisms of cultural washing, and the duty of artists and cultural workers to resist becoming complicit. It examines how art can uphold global solidarity and drive political change.\
  **Moderator:** Hane Alrustm\
  **Speakers:** Riham Barghouti, Amin El Gamal, and Melissa Nussbaum Freeman
