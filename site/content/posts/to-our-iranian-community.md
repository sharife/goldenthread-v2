### **A MESSAGE FROM OUR INCOMING ARTISTIC DIRECTOR**

**Iran is heavy on our hearts and minds as we bear witness to the horrific violence Iranians are facing for bravely raising their voices.** We support the people of Iran as they resist and mourn, and look to them to drive our solidarity. 

**As these unimaginable atrocities unfold in Iran, others continue unabated in Palestine and in Sudan.** We must never turn our eyes away from the genocide in Gaza, the genocide in Darfur, and the genocide in the Congo. As a MENA theater company we will continue to uplift the voices of Iranians, Palestinians, and Sudanese communities, and stand in solidarity with all those experiencing violence and oppression. And as an American theater company, we are watching in horror as ICE agents threaten the lives and livelihoods of immigrants and their allies.

**Our resistance is our art.** What Do the Women Say? on March 8 features Iranian, Palestinian, and Sudanese artists. Our season spotlights Iranian stories through the ReOrient Short Play Festival, uplifts Palestinian voices through A Festival of Palestinian Art, and brings an immigrant family story to the stage with *Arab Spring*.

Our immigrant and international communities are our families, friends, teachers, artists, and loved ones. #FreeIran #FreePalestine #FreeSudan #FreeCongo #TheaterStrikesICE 

In solidarity,

Nabra Nelson\
