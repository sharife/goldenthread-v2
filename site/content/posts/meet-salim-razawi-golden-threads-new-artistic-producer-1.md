Our new Artistic Producer **Salim Razawi (he/him)** is no stranger to Golden Thread — he’s been a part of our readings and productions since 2014. Since then, he’s distinguished himself in the Bay Area as an actor, director, teaching artist, casting consultant, and a passionate EDI advocate. His diverse skill set, longtime commitment to the Bay Area, and his background as an Afghan American artist and activist make him a perfect match to Golden Thread’s mission. 

“As we rev up to our ambitious 2025 Season, we’re lucky to be able to expand our artistic team with a formidable artist/leader like Salim,” says Executive Artistic Director Sahar Assaf. “Salim is a brilliant artistic mind, a kind collaborator, and a passionate advocate for our community-focused mission. He is an outspoken and brave artist, unafraid to speak his mind in solidarity with underrepresented communities, a quality that I deeply admire and find inspiring. As we started the recruiting process, his name came up countless times — recommended by past leaders, resident artists, and community members. He has built a strong reputation for himself in the Bay Area, and I am thrilled to get a chance to collaborate with him at Golden Thread!”

Salim has already started work with Sahar on the 2025 Season (look for casting calls very soon!) and will be lead-producing all artistic programming this year. We asked Salim a few questions so you can get to know him a little better!

**Welcome to Golden Thread Productions. You’re a month in — how are you doing? Any surprises?**

It’s been awesome! I started at Golden Thread as an actor in New Threads in 2014 and have returned multiple times for readings, workshops, and a production of Our Enemies. I always look for opportunities to find my way back and I am so grateful for this new opportunity to take a formal position at a place that already feels like home. The biggest surprise so far is just how mighty this team is. The Golden Thread team might be small, but everyone wears multiple hats proudly. I’m already stepping into a well-oiled machine.

**Where did you grow up? What brought you to theater and performance?**

I grew up in the East Bay. Fremont to be exact, which is also commonly known as Little Kabul. I actually came to the theatre by coincidence in middle school. I was placed in a spelling class for an elective. The first day we had a 100 word test just to understand the placement of all students. I got a 100 percent and was told I can switch to any elective. I chose drama mainly because I remembered running lines with my older sister when she was taking drama. I kept studying ever since, and so many years later, I am still having a strong passion for it. 

**What drew you to Golden Thread Productions?**

Golden Thread is the only theatre company that consistently uplifts Middle Eastern voices with authenticity and care. As an Afghan American deeply connected to the Middle Eastern North African diaspora, it has truthfully been the only space where stories from our region are told without stereotype. Golden Thread’s commitment to fostering inclusivity, challenging dominant narratives, and celebrating the rich diversity of Middle Eastern cultures resonates deeply with my own passion for creating meaningful and transformative artistic experiences for all.

**You have worked all over the Bay Area. It’s a challenging time for the theater field. What’s the biggest change you’ve noticed in the industry, and how do you think Golden Thread is positioned to respond?**

The biggest challenge I’ve noticed across the Bay Area theatre landscape is re-engaging audiences post-Pandemic. With rising inflation and economic uncertainties, people are more discerning about how they spend their money, making it difficult to sustain attendance even with affordable ticket pricing. However, Golden Thread is uniquely positioned to address this challenge through our mission-driven focus on presenting bold and relevant political theatre.

Golden Thread’s ability to bring these inherently political stories to the stage resonates with audiences seeking art that reflects their realities and challenges dominant narratives. By crafting productions that act as a form of activism, Golden Thread offers more than entertainment — it provides a space for connection, education, and dialogue. I wholeheartedly believe we understand the power of storytelling that reflects the complexities of identity, displacement, and resilience. 

Additionally, my experience working across the Bay Area has shown me the value of community engagement and strategic partnerships. Golden Thread already has so many deep partnerships in the communities we represent, but I already see new opportunities for Golden Thread to deepen our connection with local organizations and invite new audiences into the fold. This approach not only reinforces our commitment to social justice but also positions us as a leader in a theatre industry that increasingly seeks to merge artistry with meaningful societal impact.

**You are a child of immigrants – from Afghanistan. How does that come into your leadership?**

I approach my leadership style with empathy, resilience, and a deep understanding of diverse perspectives. Growing up navigating two cultures taught me the importance of inclusivity, adaptability, and listening to different voices. And having to support my immigrant parents from a young age also instilled in me a strong work ethic and the ability to advocate for underrepresented communities. Additionally as the youngest of five, my upbringing drives me to create spaces where all voices are valued and to lead with a vision that embraces both individuality and collective growth.

**You’ve had a long career in the Bay Area as an actor and director. Can you speak about your artistry, and what you are specifically interested in?**

I can best describe my artistry as rooted in storytelling that challenges different perspectives, Uplifts voices of the unheard, and fosters empathy. As both an actor and director, and even as a teaching artist, I’m drawn to work that reflects the richness of the human experience — particularly those from underrepresented communities. My work is driven by a commitment to collaboration, cultural authenticity, and making theatre accessible and transformative. I am especially interested in using performance as a tool for connection and dialogue, creating spaces where diverse voices are not only represented, but celebrated and fostered. If the audience can walk away from my work and start a dialogue in some fashion, then I call it a success.    

**What is a surprising fact that folks might not know about you?**

In addition to being somewhat of a foodie who loves to cook, try new recipes, and feed others (because food nourishes the soul and brings people together); I also  have a deep passion for coffee. As a former Coffee Master, I’m fascinated by the nuances of different beans, both Arabica and Robusta, and their unique flavor profiles. Exploring how environmental factors like altitude, soil, and climate shape each cup has turned me into a  coffee enthusiast. I also love to travel and sample local coffee cultures around the world, which enriches my appreciation for the global art of coffee-making and tasting! Did you know that coffee was first discovered by an Ethiopian Goat herder?
