Founded in 1996 by Torange Yeghiazarian, **Golden Thread Productions** has carved a unique place for itself in the American theatre to become the premier platform for the cultivation of Middle Eastern artists and plays in the U.S. After Torange stepped down, it was critical to pass the torch to an artistic leader who would keep the hard-won flame of Golden Thread’s work alive. Fortunately, after a global search, the person who took on this artistic mantle was Lebanese theatremaker **Sahar Assaf**, Golden Thread Productions’ new Executive Artistic Director since April 2021. 

Sahar showed up with an appreciation for what Torange had fostered and a curiosity to understand the needs of the Golden Thread Productions community. During her first six months, she met one-on-one with over eighty community members, including funders, Resident Artists, board, and audience members, and heard them speak about what mattered most. Almost all of them unanimously upheld the ReOrient Festival as the program they cherished the most! Over a 2-year production cycle, Sahar has successfully brought back Golden Thread Productions’ core programs culminating in ReOrient 2023 Festival.
