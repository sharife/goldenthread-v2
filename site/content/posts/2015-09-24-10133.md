At this one day recital, award–winning Syrian-American soprano Saousan Jarjour will present an exciting program of modern and jazzy interpretations of her favorite Arabic folk songs.  Accompanied by the talented Zetune Ensemble,  Jarjour  will re-imagine classics like Ziad Rahbani's “Sabah Wu Masa,” Fairouz’s “Aa Hadeer al Bosta,” and “Hal Asmar Ellon” amongst many others.

“In putting together this program,” says Ms. Jarjour, “one of the goals was to connect the past with the present, and to bridge the gap between cultures. Although jazz and Arabic music are from different parts of the world, the mixture of the two felt very natural. The spirit of improvisation lives in both styles and this fusion became quite rewarding to explore.”

Saousan Jarjour is a graduate of University of Southern California where she completed her Masters studies in Vocal Arts studying under Cynthia Munzer. She received her Bachelors of Music in voice and opera from California State University Fullerton School of Music, where she studied with Janet Smith and was coached by Mark Salters. Past performances include: Rossini’s Contessa di Folleville in _Il Viaggio a Reims_ at USC in 2014, Gretel in _Hansel and Gretel_ at CSUF in 2012, Miss Wordsworth in Benjamin Britten’s _Albert Herring_ at CSUF in 2011. Other engagements include a solo performance in Mozart’s _Requiem_ with Saddleback Community Choir in 2013. In March 2015, Ms. Jarjour was the guest soloist at Golden Thread Productions event _What Do Women Say?_ in San Francisco. Most recently, Miss Jarjour portrayed the title role in _Donia_, an excerpt of a chamber opera by Nahal Navidar and Julia Adolphe. Miss Jarjour is a voice instructor, a cantor/section leader at St. Elizabeth Anne Seton under the musical direction of Mark Salters and Terri Schmidt, and an active performer in Orange County. 

In this one-hour program, Miss Jarjour will be accompanied by the Zetune Ensemble, including Mark Herrera (Jazz pianist), Matt Richards (table), Eric Salinas (guitarist), and Michael Selfridge (bass).
