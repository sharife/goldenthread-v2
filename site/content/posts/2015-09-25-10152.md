# **Re-calibration and Re-orientation**


**by Kamee Abrahamian
Co-Chair, "Orientations" panel on Saturday, October 3, at 5pm in [ReOrient Forum 2015](https://www.goldenthread.org/forum2015)**

When we moved into a new apartment, I was afraid to let the cat out. “WHAT IF HE GOES OUTSIDE BUT FEELS SAD AND REGRETS IT THEN CAN’T FIND HIS WAY HOME?” I cried to the internet. Apparently, it takes a cat three months to recalibrate their compass and sense of space, then they should be able to find their way back instinctually.

Like a never-ending GIF, images and addresses of all the homes I have inhabited, moved between, imagined, moved back to, dreamed of—and nightmare’d of, for that matter—flickered behind my eyes. So did those of my parents and all my ancestors (I am of Armenian descent). That’s a lot of movement—and, consequently, there must have been a lot of re-calibration and re-orientation happening in all those instances. It’s still happening, really. 

Trauma is passed down to us, along with an inherited sense of exile. It still lives in our landscape, in the wailing wind. Like a cat with a relocating family, our compasses have been shaken; and so has the ground we walk on, our ‘selves’, our identities and perspectives, our communities and relationships. But I’m not a cat. I need more than three months. I probably need a lifetime. That, then, is why I ‘re-orient’. It isn’t much of a choice, but it feels important anyway. It’s also why I chose to work with lee, and on _Dear Armen_ respectively.
