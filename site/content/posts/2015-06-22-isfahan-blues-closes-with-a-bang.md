We are thrilled to announce that_ Isfahan Blues_ reached a record-breaking high in audience numbers this May. With over 2,000 tickets sold, there was hardly an empty-seat in the entire theater!

We are so proud to have shared this production with so many, and whether this was your first time seeing a Golden Thread production or you're a seasoned Golden Thread audience member, we hope you'll join us this September for the [**ReOrient 2015 Festival of Short Plays & Forum! **](https://www.goldenthread.org/reorient-festival-2015/)

**THANK YOU** to the dedicated team of artists who made _Isfahan Blues_ happen! We also want to acknowledge our volunteers, who donate their time and energy, and the community partners, who brought new audiences from all over the Bay Area to this production. And finally, a heartfelt thank you to our co-producers, the **[African-American Shakespeare Company!](http://african-americanshakes.org/)** We couldn't have asked for more committed and passionate collaborators.
