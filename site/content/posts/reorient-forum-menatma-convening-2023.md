  MIDDLE EASTERN NORTH AFRICAN THEATER MAKERS ALLIANCE (MENATMA)

  2023 FALL CONVENING

  Golden Thread Productions and Art2Action, Inc. are thrilled to co-produce and co-present the 4th annual convening of the Middle Eastern North African Theater Makers Alliance (MENATMA) hosted at Golden Thread’s ReOrient Festival of Short Plays in San Francisco.

   

  MENATMA amplifies the voices of Middle Eastern and North African theater makers and expands how stories from and about our communities are told on U.S. stages. We will take space, make opportunities, champion artists, and build relationships with other marginalized communities and allies to build a more vibrant American theater.

   

  The 2023 Annual Convening brings together SWANA artists, activists, and scholars from around the country for panel and roundtable discussions, workshops, artistic presentations, networking opportunities, and more. Registration is free, but advanced registration is required.
