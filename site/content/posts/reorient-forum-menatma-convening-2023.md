As part of ReOrient Forum, which offers artists and scholars a platform for conversations around the festival’s themes, Golden Thread is pleased to host the annual national convening of the Middle Eastern and North African Theater-Makers Alliance ([MENATMA](https://www.menatheatre.org/)), on October 27, 28, and 29. The convening brings together SWANA artists, activists, and scholars from around the country and the MENA diaspora for panel and roundtable discussions, workshops, artistic presentations, networking opportunities, and more. With sessions open to the public and live-streamed on HowlRound, this year’s convening is co- produced by Art2Action, Inc. and sponsored by New Arab American Theatre Works, Noor Theatre, and Silk Road Rising. \

“We are so proud that the only national coalition advocating for and raising the visibility of the Middle Eastern and North African theater artists in the country was planned by over 100 artists who gathered at our ReOrient Forum 2019,” says Golden Thread's [Executive Artistic Director Sahar Assaf](https://goldenthread.org/posts/meet-sahar-assaf-our-new-executive-artistic-director/). She adds, “MENATMA is a tangible and long-lasting impact of the Festival, embodying the diversity and inclusivity that is at the heart of Golden Thread’s mission.”
