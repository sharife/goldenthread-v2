Welcome to Golden Thread’s season content guide. Here you’ll find a more in-depth description of each production as well as other content information intended to help our patrons engage with our work as they choose.

We have tried to include content that is considered to be of a sensitive nature, but this list does not necessarily cover every subject of concern. Some content may be only briefly mentioned, while other content may be a more major theme or central aspect of the play.

If you wish to know more about the content you see here, please contact the box office by phone or email. We would be happy to provide more information.
