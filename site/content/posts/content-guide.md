### Stamp Me

#### by Yussef El Guindi

Ahmed is waiting in an immigration line as his thoughts race, skid, and trip him up as he anticipates the things that might be asked, the papers he’ll have to show, and the personal information he might have to share. It is not a pretty stream of consciousness.

### Closure

### Data Queen

#### by Adam Ashraf Elsayigh

Lebanese Gen-Z Partyboi Sam is in trouble with his tamer, older, White boyfriend Joel. But it’s really not his fault Joel went snooping, finding Sam’s FUCK FORM, with all the raunchy descriptions of his recent hookups. So here they are at ODYSSEY, San Francisco’s hottest, new Couple Therapy practice. Will Sam and Joel manage to fix this hot mess with the assistance of their overwhelmed but well-meaning counselor, Sharon… or is this all doomed for failure? **Content Advisories: Strong language, reference to substance use, reference to traumatic events.** 

### A Massacre

#### b﻿y Katrin Arefy

Discovering a pile of dead bodies in the middle of their office, work colleagues seem nonchalant to the carnage and instead become embroiled in petty arguments. Their repetitive discussions and responses are predetermined and non-negotiable. **Content Advisories: Depiction of dead bodies, loud screams.**

### Picture Bride

### Returning to Haifa

By **Ghassan Kanafani**
Adapted for the stage by **Naomi Wallace** and **Ismail Khalidi**

In the wake of the 1967 Six-Day War, with the borders finally open after two decades, Said and Safiyya, a Palestinian couple, return to Haifa in search of the echoes of a home they were forced to abandon during the Nakba in 1948. But are they truly ready for the encounter that awaits them upon their return?** *Returning to Haifa*** presents a deeply human portrait of two families, one Palestinian, and one Israeli Jewish, forced by history into an intimacy they didn’t choose.

In a farce of a play within a play within a play, fractals of a writer’s identity battle over controlling the narrative. When they start eliminating each other, it becomes unclear who is writing whom. **Content Advisories: Descriptions of family separation, war violence, infanticide. Use of loud sounds including gunshots and artillery explosions.**
