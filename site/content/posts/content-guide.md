## A Thousand Strange Places: Anthony Shadid and the Middle East

written by Robert Myers, directed by Sahar Assaf

The play dramatizes the life and career of the Pulitzer Prize-winning, Lebanese-American journalist Anthony Shadid during the tumultuous decade of 2002-2012. He is wounded in Palestine, awaits the American invasion of Iraq in Baghdad, covers the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 2006, the fall of Mubarak in Tahrir Square, and is kidnapped in Libya while reporting on the civil war there. As an Arabic speaker and a brilliant writer, he re-defined the role of a reporter and was one of the only correspondents who covered the lives of people from the Arab world from every walk of life.

## What to Expect When You Are Simulating Expecting

written by Nabra Nelson, directed by Susannah Martin

In the year 2080, the new normal involves taboos on pregnancy, car ownership, red meat, and suburban homes. It involves travel restrictions, a mixed-race majority, ongoing climate disasters, and constant uncertainty. But other than that, everything is the old normal. Except for Hoda’s experimental pregnancy. As Hoda gets ever-closer to her dream life – a home safe in Canada, away from Seattle’s floods and wildfires, and a nuclear family to settle down with – things don’t seem to be going as planned. As she waits for her husband Ahmed to adopt a child from Egypt to round out their family, she starts getting pains that her doctor can’t explain, and she meets an intriguing new friend named JeeYoung. The clock ticks as the Big One approaches to wash away Hoda’s plans, but she is determined to fly away in time. An intense yet comedic experience, this near-futuristic play simulates the unexpected.

## Pilgrimage

written by Humaira Ghilzai and Bridgette Dutta Portman, directed by Aidaa Peerzada

Five Muslim American women embark on an Umrah, a minor pilgrimage, to Mecca. Noor, an Afghan American immigrant with a secret, hopes the journey will give her the absolution she desperately seeks. Her tech CEO daughter Maryam, struggling with legal woes, sees the trip as a way to rebrand herself, while Noor’s nieces, the estranged sisters Sosan and Nadia, work to mend their fractured relationship while fulfilling the Umrah rituals as a requisite to receive their inheritance. Meanwhile, Fatima, a Black Muslim convert, hopes to find her biological mother. Will these five women find the spiritual reawakening they seek, or will secrets, rivalries, and old wounds tear them apart?

## HOME?

written and performed by Hend Ayoub, directed by Carey Perloff

An autobiographical solo show about a young woman's journey to retrieve and imagine a new sense of home. Through a panoply of vivid characters—from a five-year-old who just wants to join the neighborhood's Purim party to a casting director in Egypt who can't forget where she comes from, to her dying mother who longs for her to find a place in the world—Hend shares a deeply personal and true story about her search for the place that many of us take for granted: Home.
