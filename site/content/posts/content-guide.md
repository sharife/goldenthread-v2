### Returning to Haifa

By **Ghassan Kanafani**
Adapted for the stage by **Naomi Wallace** and **Ismail Khalidi**

In the wake of the 1967 Six-Day War, with the borders finally open after two decades, Said and Safiyya, a Palestinian couple, return to Haifa in search of the echoes of a home they were forced to abandon during the Nakba in 1948. But are they truly ready for the encounter that awaits them upon their return?** *Returning to Haifa*** presents a deeply human portrait of two families, one Palestinian, and one Israeli Jewish, forced by history into an intimacy they didn’t choose.

In a farce of a play within a play within a play, fractals of a writer’s identity battle over controlling the narrative. When they start eliminating each other, it becomes unclear who is writing whom. **Content Advisories: Descriptions of family separation and war violence. References of child casualties. Use of loud sounds including gunshots and artillery explosions.**
