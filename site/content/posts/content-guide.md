### Arab Play Cycle

**written by Hassan Abdulrazzak**, **Hannah Khalil**, **Mona Mansour and** **directed by Evren Odcikin**

A couple on an uncomfortable mini-break; a pair of mothers with a child who won’t wake up; and two post-COVID 19, post-Capitol riots encounters; form this new triptych play cycle by three acclaimed Arab writers. 

**Content Advisories by play:**

***A Delicate Poison* by Hassan Abdulrazzak**\
This play is an absurdist comedy dealing with difficult and triggering topics, and includes in action and language: racialized microaggressions and gaslighting; misogyny; xenophobia; violence against Muslims; drug use; and sexual assault.  

***Only Connect by Mona Mansour***\
The COVID-19 pandemic and social isolation are a central theme of the play.  

***The Cure by Hannah Khalil***\
The play has depictions and descriptions of ailing and injured children, as well as references to bombings.

Despite being in different countries (Hassan and Hannah in the UK and Mona in the US) the trio worked closely, connecting online and taking each other’s ideas as inspiration. They spent time talking about what felt important and resonant after this time of change. The result is a series of satirical, moving and poignant vignettes that will give audiences much food for thought.

### Operation No Penetration: Lysistrata 97!

##### Adapted and directed by Torange Yeghiazarian from Kenneth McLiesh's translation of Aristophanes' Lysistrata

An outrageous comedy about sex and war.

**Content Advisory: Satirical depictions of misogyny, sexual coercion, and harassment. References to gendered violence and oppression.**

THE ORIGINAL PLAY: Produced in 411 BC, Aristophanes' Lysistrata is one of the most popular of the extant Greek comedies. It followed shortly on a disastrous phase of Athens’s war with Sparta. Many of Aristophanes plays use a utopian premise to criticize war. Lysistrata addresses the politics of its time in a variety of ways. Lampooning the politicians of the time and Athens’s expansionist policies on the one hand, and utilizing the social inferiority of the women in Athens as a comic ploy, on the other hand. Aristophanes was a master at highlighting social hypocrisies. But at the same time the play is by no means "feminist" in its approach. Aristophanes pleads for peace and advocates family values of his own time, seeing women as child bearers and home makers with sexuality being their only weapon.

THE ADAPTATION: To fully reap the sows of Aristophanes political commentary, a contemporary adaptation needs to address the politics of its own time. Certainly the role of women in our society has changed, albeit slightly!, from Aristophanes' era. This cannot be ignored. War remains, but the players are different. The United States may be the Athens of today; the global leader, economically and militarily. This adaptation focuses on the relationship between the US and the Middle East. Islamic Fundamentalism is currently being thrown around as the one remaining enemy, the force that threatens "Democracy" in the world today. In this production Iran is being presented as a background player, with Palestine and Israel as the main warring parties. The play is really designed to speak directly to its audience, however. And since it is being produced in the US, it seems important to set the play in the US as well. In this production, the Jewish-American Lysistrata along with the Palestinian-American Kalonike, unite women from around the world, including the Iranian Lampito, to join in on a global sex strike in order to force men to stop war and sign the World Peace treaty. The play attempts to emphasize the global nature of war in our time and the need for a global peace settlement.

### Nine Armenians

##### by Leslie Ayvazian, directed by Torange Yeghiazarian. Winner of Roger L. Stevens and the Susan Smith Blackburn Award

An Armenian-American family's journey towards accepting the past and embracing the future.

###### **Content Advisory: Realistic depictions of memory loss, aging, and loss/grief. References to Armenian genocide, intergenerational trauma, poverty and oppression.**

In this award-wining play, Leslie Ayvazian has beautifully depicted the reality of facing a horrific past without shame or fear. The grandparents in the play are survivors of the Armenian genocide who never taught their children how to speak Armenian because they wanted them to be real Americans. But now, as the grandfather is facing his own mortality, he feels an urgency to impart the truth to the next generation. His death in the first scene is the impetus for the eldest daughter to travel to Armenia for the first time. She must see with her own eyes what she has only been told about all her life.

### Love Missile

##### An Anti-war comedy musical with puppets by Hal Gelb, Janaki Ranpura, Torange Yeghiazarian, and directed by Norman Gee

A surreal tale of passion, greed, denial and longing involving unspeakable bodily functions.

**Content Advisory: Satirical depictions of war and addiction. References to deportation, displacement, family separation, crude language and bathroom humor.**

*Love Missile* is a fusion of a traditional American musical with Middle Eastern undertones and fantastical shadow puppetry. When a Godzilla attack interrupts the source of Shappa-Imageanna’s addiction to consumer goods, their President uses it as an excuse to wage war on Distancia, a far-off dictatorship that had nothing to do with the attack – but happens to have a whole lot of a vital “natural” resource (aka human excrement!). The prominent scientist, Dr Z and his newly arrived assistant Sharifa, a legal immigrant from Distancia, work feverishly to find alternatives, but ultimately importing the goods is the only option and as it turns out, Distancia has the best goods! When the dictator of Distancia rejects the generous offers made by Shappa-Imageanna’s President, he has no alternative but to attack – with Love, a drug that induces universal love developed by Dr. Z and Sharifa, who is manipulated into developing the missiles that will rain down on her own country. Is Love all we really need?
