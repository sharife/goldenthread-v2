**Title: There Is A Field: Screening & Discussion**

**Description:** In October 2000, a police officer shot and killed unarmed 17-year old Asel Asleh. His story is tragically familiar for Americans, but Asel was not killed in Ferguson, New York City, Atlanta, or Minneapolis. Asel was a Palestinian teenager who was murdered by Israeli police as he participated in a demonstration, calling for an end to the Israeli occupation and settler-colonization. There Is A Field began as a play about Asel, told from the perspective of his older sister, Nardin. Through Nardin’s struggle to cope with the murder of her brother, the play offers a uniquely personal lens for learning about intersecting systems of oppression, including Zionism and white supremacy—root causes of state-sanctioned violence and structural racism. Donkeysaddle Projects filmed a performance-reading of There Is A Field, performed by activists, artists and organizers from the Movement for Black Lives. There Is A Field film weaves together their performance with archival footage of Asel, and the activists’ own realizations of the parallels they see between Asel’s story and the experiences of Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) communities in the United States. The film, set in Palestine and performed by BIPOC artists and activists in the US, builds solidarity across intersectional struggles for liberation and decolonization, and is sure to spark conversation and connection.

**Moderator:** Aejay Mitchell (Actor)

**Duration:** 90 minutes

**1:00 AM Pacific | 4:00 AM Eastern | 11:00 AM Palestine** 

**Title: Palestine Censored; an international Siege on Art & Culture**

**Description:** Censorship can be bold and visible. It can also be subtle and sly. In all cases, suppressing words, ideas, and images reflects the lack of confidence of a society in itself. The recent Israeli war on Gaza, West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Lebanon activated censorship in several countries including European countries and the United States of America, which had proclaimed themselves as defenders and proponents of freedoms, specifically freedom of expression. Artists, scholars, academics, journalists, students, employees are constantly being canceled, silenced, or challenged whenever they directly or indirectly reference Palestine or the current atrocities unfolding before our eyes in Palestine and Lebanon. This conversation brings together Lebanese artists who have witnessed or have had to deal with censorship or attempts of censorship since October 7th, 2024, to reflect on their experiences, the different faces and forms of censorship today, and how to handle it to protect and to practice freedom of expression across borders.
