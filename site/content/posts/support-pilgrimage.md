#### **Palestinian narratives need and deserve your support --** [DONATE NOW!](https://goldenthread.my.salesforce-sites.com/donate/?dfId=a0n3Z00000tn4RsQAI)

Golden Thread is proud to produce *The Return*, the powerful play by Hanna Eady and Edward Mast. This moving piece highlights the erasure and violence Palestinians endure in their daily lives inside Israel. Eady, who grew up Palestinian in Northern Israel, brings that lived experience to this taut, hard-hitting two-hander and is directing the play.

**The production continues our firm commitment to uplift Palestinian artists and center Palestinian narratives.** The Return builds on our deeply impactful 2024 Season for Palestine, sustaining our response to the ongoing Palestinian genocide.

These are frightening times in the world and in the U.S., and the pressure to remain silent in the face of war, fascism, and genocide is strong. At Golden Thread, we are resisting this silencing of dissent with brave, powerful narratives like *The Return*. **Lift your voice and help bring this impactful and important production to the Bay Area!**

**ABOUT *THE RETURN***\
Two people meeting in an auto-body shop in the mid-sized city of Herzliya, Israel. They might or might not have known each other in the past. One of them is Palestinian, one of them is Israeli Jewish, and by the end of the play, both of their lives will be changed forever by the realities that surround them. This production is presented in partnership with Art2Action, Inc.

**ABOUT THE PLAYWRIGHTS**\
**Hanna Eady and Edward Mast** have been writing plays together since they met in Seattle in 1995. Hanna Eady grew up as a Palestinian in Northern Israel and had come to Seattle years earlier for graduate school in directing. Edward Mast was returning home from his first of many trips to the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Their first collaboration was *Sahmatah*, a play drawn from testimonies by residents of one of the Palestinian villages destroyed during the founding of Israel in 1948. *Sahmatah* premiered in 1996 in Seattle, and then premiered in Arabic in 1998 on the original site of the village itself inside what is now Israel. Other plays they have written together include *Loved Ones: Families of the Incarcerated, Letters from Palestine in the Time of the Virus, The Love Tunnel: A Comedy of Occupation*, and *The Mulberry Tree*, which recently premiered in New York.
