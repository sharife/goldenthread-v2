### *Pilgrimage* is the first play by an Afghan woman to receive a professional production in the U.S.

Golden Thread Productions and Z Space present the world premiere of *Pilgrimage* by Humaira Ghilzai and Bridgette Dutta Portman. The play follows five Afghan and Muslim American women on an Umrah, a minor pilgrimage to Mecca. As they make the journey, long-buried secrets and simmering tensions surface, testing friendships, exposing family truths, and challenging what they believe about themselves, each other and their faith.

*P﻿ilgrimage* is a bold depiction of Afghan and Muslim women that challenges the stereotypes about them that pervade U.S. culture. A moving and often funny family drama, *P﻿ilgrimage* explores a familiar tension in many immigrant families — the gaps between tradition and lived experience, inherited faith and personal belief, what we hold onto and what we struggle to carry. The characters are vibrant, funny, and flawed — unapologetically human women who defy the clichés that dominate Western narratives about Muslim women.
Help us make herstory with this rare and unique new play!

Five women embark on a pilgrimage to Mecca. Noor, an Afghan American immigrant, must fulfill her sister’s last wish. Her daughter, Maryam, a tech CEO, seeks to evade her legal woes, while Noor’s nieces—estranged sisters Sosan and Nadia—must complete the pilgrimage to claim their inheritance. Meanwhile, Fatima, a Black Muslim convert and Nadia’s best friend, hopes to find her biological mother. Will this pilgrimage bring the five women closer, or will secrets, rivalries, and old wounds tear them apart?
