On November 29, 2023, Golden Thread and [Aviva Arts](https://www.avivaarts.org/) collaborated on a reading of [ASHTAR Theatre](https://www.ashtar-theatre.org/)â€™s [The Gaza Monologues](https://www.gazamonologues.com/) in observance of the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People - an annual commemoration established by the UN aimed at raising awareness about Palestine and supporting justice, equality, and freedom for the Palestinian people.

*The Gaza Monologues* are testimonies written by Gazan youth in 2010, after the first war on the Gaza Strip. Tragically, these monologues are still accurate today. They highlight the horrors, hopes, and resilience of the courageous Gazans, lifting up the voices of children and people in Gaza.

The reading was presented in Arabic, English, and Farsi. To download the Gaza Monologues and read along in different languages please visit: [The Gaza Monologues](https://www.gazamonologues.com/copy-of-team) scripts page.
