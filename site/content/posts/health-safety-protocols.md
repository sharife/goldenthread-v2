Our health and safety protocols have been adapted to comply with current health and safety protocols provided by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. These are subject to change according to government and health expert recommendations and industry standards.

Our current measures include:

* Requiring proof of full vaccination. A negative COVID-19 test is acceptable in cases of medical or religious exemption.
* Mandatory well fitted masks that completely cover nose and mouth, secured with ear loops or head strap (gaiters and bandanas are not acceptable).
* Increasing space between audience members.
* A no-touch or low-touch experience at the theater.
* Additional cleaning before, during and after performances.

**PROOF OF FULL VACCINATION**
All patrons age 12 and up are required to show proof, prior to admittance, of full COVID vaccination.
Full vaccination is defined as completion of the two-dose regimen of Pfizer or Moderna vaccines or one dose of Johnson & Johnson vaccine administered two weeks or more in advance of attendance. Fully vaccinated patrons must bring a paper, photo, or electronic copy of their completed vaccination card or a record of vaccination directly from the healthcare provider who administered the vaccine with an appropriate ID matching the name on the proof of vaccination for entry.
A negative COVID-19 test (a PCR test taken not more than 72 hours before the event or an antigen test taken not more than 24 hours before the event) is acceptable in the case of medical or religious exemption. A paper, photo, or electronic copy of the negative COVID-19 test result with an appropriate ID matching the name on the proof of negative COVID-19 test would be required for entry. Patrons with this exemption should contact the box office in advance to request reasonable accommodation.

**WELL-FITTED MASKS**
A well fitted face covering is required for entry and must be worn at all times. Face masks must completely cover your nose and mouth and have ear loops or head straps to hold it in place. Gaiters and bandannas are not acceptable.
All staff and crew will be masked. Actors will be unmasked only when performing. Patrons must remain masked for the entire duration of the program, including the talkback.

**SOCIAL DISTANCING**
At this time, we are limiting seating capacity to 50%, which is 40 seats out of a capacity of 80. Attendees must register in advance and seating will be assigned by the theater after registration.
We ask that you make every effort to maintain a 6-foot distance when in line for the entrance or at the restrooms. Staff will be on hand or floor markings will be marked where possible to assist with maintaining social distancing.
The theater will open one hour prior to the performance. We encourage patrons to arrive 30 minutes prior to the performance, to allow adequate time for safety protocols. Once you have checked in, please go directly to your seat and do not congregate in the lobby.
At the end of the program, Staff will facilitate a row-by-row exit to maintain distancing in high-traffic areas.
No visitors will be allowed backstage and there can absolutely be no physical interaction between the actors, stage managers and patrons during the talkback.

**LOW OR NO TOUCH**
Patrons will check-in at the front entrance, where they will also provide proof of vaccination and confirm their negative self-assessment. They will be informed of their seat assignment and directed to their seats. 
Printed programs will not be distributed. A QR code will be provided to view program and artist information.
Hand sanitizing stations will be placed throughout the lobby and in the restrooms.
We will not be offering any food or drink at the concessions bar and the drinking fountains are currently closed.

***ADDITIONAL MEASURES***

**SELF-ASSESSMENT**
We ask that you self-assess your health before leaving home by considering the following questions:

1. Within the past 10 days, have you been diagnosed with, or tested positive for, COVID-19?
2. In the past 10-14 days, have you had close contact with anyone who has COVID-19, during their contagious period?

   The CDC reports that people with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. This list does not include all possible symptoms.

   With your attendance, you acknowledge that you have reviewed and answered “no” to all these questions. If you answer yes to any, pleases stay home and contact the box office to arrange an exchange or refund.

   Remember to bring your mask. A well fitted face covering is required for entry and must be worn at all times. Face masks must completely cover your nose and mouth and have ear loops or head straps to hold it in place. Gaiters and bandannas are not acceptable.
