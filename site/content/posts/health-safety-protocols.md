The health and safety of our artists, audiences and staff is our highest priority. In addition to the protocols posted here, we are practicing additional measures within our offices and rehearsal halls that further ensure the health and safety of our artists, audiences and staff.

Our health and safety protocols have been adapted to comply with current health and safety protocols provided by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. These are subject to change according to government and health expert recommendations and industry standards.

Our current measures include:

* Requiring proof of full vaccination.
* Mandatory well fitted masks that completely cover nose and mouth, secured with ear loops or head strap (gaiters and bandanas are not acceptable).
* A no-touch or low-touch experience at the theater.
* Additional cleaning before and after performances.

**PROOF OF FULL VACCINATION**
All patrons age 12 and up are required to show proof, prior to admittance, of full, up to date COVID vaccination.

Full, up to date vaccination is defined as completion of the two-dose regimen of Pfizer or Moderna vaccines or one dose of Johnson & Johnson vaccine administered two weeks or more in advance of attendance. Booster vaccination when eligible is recommended for all audiences and requested for all staff and artists. Fully vaccinated patrons must bring a paper, photo, or electronic copy of their completed vaccination card or a record of vaccination directly from the healthcare provider who administered the vaccine with an appropriate ID matching the name on the proof of vaccination for entry.

**WELL-FITTED MASKS**
A well-fitted face covering is required for entry and must be worn at all times. Face masks must completely cover your nose and mouth and have ear loops or head straps to hold it in place. Gaiters and bandannas are not acceptable.

Per CDC guidance, we encourage the use of procedural masks (either alone or with a cloth mask on top) or a higher grade N95 or KN95 mask instead of cloth masks alone. Masks must be worn in all areas of the theatre. No eating or drinking will be allowed inside the theater before or during the performance or intermission.

All staff and crew will be masked. Actors and artists such as the director or playwright will be unmasked only when performing or during the talkback. Patrons must remain masked for the entire duration of the program, including the talkback.

**SOCIAL DISTANCING**
At this time, we are not limiting seating capacity. Seating continues to be general admission unless otherwise specified. Advanced purchase or registration is advised.

We ask that you make every effort to maintain a 6-foot distance when in line for the entrance or at the restrooms. Staff will be on hand or floor markings will be marked where possible to assist with maintaining social distancing.

The theater will open one hour prior to the performance. We encourage patrons to arrive 30 minutes prior to the performance, to allow adequate time for safety protocols. Once you have checked in, please go directly to your seat and do not congregate in the lobby.

No visitors will be allowed backstage and there can absolutely be no physical interaction between the actors, stage managers and patrons during the talkback.

**SELF-ASSESSMENT**
We ask that you self-assess your health before leaving home by considering the following questions:

Within the past 10 days, have you been diagnosed with, or tested positive for, COVID-19?

In the past 10-14 days, have you had close contact with anyone who has COVID-19, during their contagious period?

In the last 24 hours, including today, have you had any of the symptoms below, that is new or not explained by another condition?

* Fever or chills
* Cough
* Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
* Fatigue
* Muscle or body aches
* Headache
* New loss of taste or smell
* Sore throat
* Congestion or runny nose
* Nausea or vomiting
* Diarrhea

The CDC reports that people with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. This list does not include all possible symptoms.

With your attendance, you acknowledge that you have reviewed and answered “no” to all these questions. If you answer yes to any, pleases stay home and contact the box office to arrange an exchange.

For any questions, please contact the box office by email (boxoffice@goldenthread.org) or phone at (415) 505-4162. Calls and emails will be monitored and returned Monday–Friday from 10am to 6pm.
