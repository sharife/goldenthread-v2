      bio: >-
        **Ashira Ali Darwish** is the founder of Catharsis Holistic Healing, a
        trauma therapy project in Palestine. She is known for pioneering Sufi
        active meditation to help people suffering from continuous trauma. This
        type of active meditation draws its roots from ancestral and Indigenous
        knowledge. Her personal journey of healing from full body paralysis with
        a severed spinal cord in 2012 has given her a deep insight into the
        process of recovery and healing. This unique perspective allows her to
        offer a highly specialized and culturally sensitive approach to trauma
        healing.


        In 2021, she received the "ISABS Honours" from the Indian Society for Applied Behavioural Science for her contribution to positive societal transformation through the application of behavioral science principles and practices. 


        Ashira started her career in Palestine as a journalist; she worked for 15 years as TV & Radio journalist and researcher for the BBC, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.
