The ReOrient Festival was conceived in 1999 to meet the urgent and ongoing need for Middle Eastern voices in American theatre and to create a home where Middle Eastern artists are nurtured and supported. The festival aims to showcase the vast variety of voices and styles emerging from and inspired by the Middle East and to bring together diverse communities to engage with the region. At the same time, the ReOrient Festival helps to demystify the region by encouraging writing about the Middle East by playwrights from all cultural, ethnic, and national backgrounds. Today, celebrating the festival's tenth anniversary, ReOrient continues to be guided by these principles, serving as a forum for addressing current events and personal experiences.

In association with the festival, Golden Thread will present ReOrient Forum a two-day gathering of theatre artists and field specialists engaging in discussions about Middle Eastern-American Theatre, Internet conferencing with theatre artists in the Middle East, and an original play interactively performed in San Francisco and Cairo via the Internet. In addition, Golden Thread is proud to showcase the best of Bay Area Middle Eastern Arts by featuring performances by Ballet Afsaneh and ASWAT Bay Area Arabic.
