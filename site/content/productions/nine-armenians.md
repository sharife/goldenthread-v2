heading: An Armenian-American family’s journey towards accepting the past and
  embracing the future.
description: "*Nine Armenians* is the story of three generations of
  Armenian-Americans embracing the future by connecting with their history. In
  this award-winning play, Leslie Ayvazian has beautifully depicted the reality
  of facing a horrific past without shame or fear. The Armenian Genocide is a
  particularly sensitive subject, as the Turkish government has never
  acknowledged it.The playwright takes a risk by shedding light on the painful
  recollections of the past.But isn’t this validation the only way to reach
  understanding and restore faith in the future?"
