        text: "***Oh My Sweet Land*** is a solo show created by Palestinian writer Amir
          Nizar Zuabi, founder of Haifa-based theatre company ShiberHu, and
          German-Syrian actor Corrinne Jaber. Featuring Nora el Samahy and
          directed by Torange Yeghiazarian, this urgent and extraordinary show
          explores the crisis in Syria through one woman’s fictional story based
          on interviews with hundreds of Syrian refugees in Jordan. The play is
          set in a kitchen and performed as the actor prepares the Syrian
          delicacy, kibbeh. A presentation of the play will tour Bay Area
          kitchens in the fall as part of Golden Thread’s 2017 Season."

      bio: "**Reem Assil** founded Reem’s with a passion for the flavors of Arab
        street-corner bakeries and the vibrant communities around them. Growing
        up in a Palestinian-Syrian household, Reem was surrounded by the aromas
        and tastes of food from the homeland and the connections they evoked of
        her heritage, family, and community. Before dedicating herself to a
        culinary career, Reem worked for a decade as a community and labor
        organizer. In 2010, she traveled to Syria and Lebanon, and there, in a
        bakery where flatbreads were flying through the air, her vision for
        Reem’s was born to create the experience of Arab hospitality through the
        street corner bakery experience. She came back and immediately enrolled
        herself in a baking and pastry program and has since then worked with
        the Bay Area’s esteemed cooperative bakery Arizmendi Bakery & Pizzeria,
        Grace Street Catering, Local Flavors, and several local chefs."
    - bio: A captivating harpist and songwriter, **Amelia Romano** brings unexpected
        colors to her playing. Creating her own style by blending dynamic
        rhythms and raw vocals, she produces an intimate and energizing
        experience that defies tradition. Her latest album titled “New
        Perspectives” features fiery and dynamic compositions, a tango style
        Mexican Bolero, Contemporary Flamenco Music, Venezuelan Joropo, and a
        touch of American Blues. These compositions reflect lyrics of her
        personal stories of loss and love that leaves the listener clamoring for
        more.

Two extraordinary works of art created by Middle Eastern artists responding to the Syrian refugee crisis anchor the event: an excerpt reading of ***Oh My Sweet Land***, a tour-de-force solo show based on interviews with Syrian refugees in Jordan, and an excerpt from the documentary film ***We Are Not Princesses***, which centers on *Antigone of Syria*, a 2014 drama workshop and performance featuring 35 Syrian women refugees in Lebanon. The event also features music by vocalist **Dina Zarif** accompanied by harpist Amelia Romano, and food for purchase from **Reem’s**, which serves traditional Arab street food made with California love. Founding artistic director Torange Yeghiazarian will lead a conversation and audience Q&A with artists **Nora el Samahy** (Egyptian-American actress of *Oh My Sweet Land*), **Sara Maamouri** (Tunisian-American editor of *We Are Not Princesses*), Iranian vocalist **Dina Zarif**, and Syrian- Palestinian-American chef **Reem Assil**. A portion of the proceeds will benefit **International Rescue Committee Oakland**, which provides essential services to refugees in the Bay Area.
