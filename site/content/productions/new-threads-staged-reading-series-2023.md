        text: In the 1960s, Algeria established itself as the anti-colonial capital of
          the world, hosting multiple revolutionaries including the Black
          Panther Party. *The Fox and the Panther* follows the building of a
          friendship between Nasi and Kati and their struggle to find where they
          belong in the world. The play examines the idea of borders, not just
          national but cultural and familial as well. Nasi and Kati both
          struggle to connect with their parents in a time of great political
          change.

          In 2011, techie Alaa Abd El-Fattah emerged as a leading voice in the
          Egyptian Revolution through his animated political writings and
          activism. But Alaa has spent much of the decade since in Cairo
          Prisons, unlawfully held by a military regime seeking to crush him and
          the revolutionary movement he belonged to.\

          *Yet, they fail every day.*\

          Weaving writings and personal testimonials from Alaa and his family members, alongside vivid memoryscapes and haunting images, **Alaa: A Family Trilogy** is an epic dramatization of a single family's unwavering resistance at the heart of a nation's fight for justice.
