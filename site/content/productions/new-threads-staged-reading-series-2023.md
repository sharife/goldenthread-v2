          by **Tariq Hamami**

          dramaturgy by **Dawn Monique Williams**
        text: Inspired by the Black Panthers’ residency in Algiers in the 1960s, Tariq
          Hamami explores the intersection of the Black American and Algerian
          battle against colonialism and white supremacy. Drawing from his own
          family history, Hamami is developing a new play centering the Algerian
          experience, while highlighting the global interconnection in our
          ongoing struggle for freedom and human dignity.

          by **Adam Ashraf Elsayigh**

          generative dramaturgy by **Salma Zohdi**
        text: Adam Ashraf Elsayigh and Salma Zohdi are developing a new play that honors
          the story of British-Egyptian blogger and high-profile political
          prisoner, Abd El-Fattah, who has spent much of the last decade and
          remains to this day imprisoned in Cairo. Abd El-Fattah continues to
          write from his confinement, somehow smuggling treatises to the outside
          world. Elsayigh’s *Alaa* will invite audiences into a world that
          juxtaposes physical storytelling and embodied ritual using Abd
          El-Fattah’s recently-anthologized writings.
