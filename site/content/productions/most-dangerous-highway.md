  A fearless eight-year old businessman makes his living directing traffic with
  a soda bottle on the highway connecting Jalalabad to Kabul. Soldiers,
  accidents, and ghosts are no match for this little fighter with a knack for
  surviving the toughest challenges. Inspired by a [New York
  Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/world/asia/afghan-boys-eke-living-amid-peril-at-gorge.html?_r=1)
  article about the real-life “Pepsi bottle boys” of Afghanistan, this poetic
  play introduces an up-and-coming writer of great promise.<br /><br />Kevin
  Artigue is a graduate of Public Theater’s prestigious Emerging Writers Group
  and the first playwright of non-Middle Eastern descent to be produced on the
  Golden Thread mainstage. He has been developing this play with Golden Thread
  for three years, including as part of the 2014 National New Play Network’s
  showcase.

        Kiran Patel attends San Francisco Friends School, where he has been an
        avid member of the theatre community. Kiran’s role in his school’s
        fourth grade production of <em>Hangtown</em> gave birth to his love and
        passion for acting. While in the fifth grade, Kiran played a lead
        comedic role in an after­school production about capitalism called
        <em>Corn Cobbers</em>, loosely based on Animal Farm. During the past
        summer, Kiran attended acting camp at the A.C.T. to further refine his
        skills. This fall, as a seventh grader, Kiran is in two plays: <em>A
        Midsummer Night’s Dream</em> and <em>Little Women</em>. His versatility
        is shown through the drastic differences in the demeanors of his
        characters. Puck is a playful and mischievous elf, while Brooke is a
        serious and level­headed tutor.

        Louel Señores </strong> is excited to be working with Golden Thread
        Productions for the first time! You may have recently seen him in
        <em>Civil</em> (Quantum Dragon), <em>Sheherazade&#8217;s Last Tales</em>
        (PCSF), or <em>In Plain Sight </em>(Those Women Productions). Or you may
        have <em>not</em> seen him <em>less</em> recently when he stage managed
        <em>The Language Archive</em> and <em>Emilie</em> with Symmetry Theatre
        or with various shows at previous SF Fringe Festivals
        (<em>Ceremony</em>, <em>Babies: The Ultimate Birth Control,</em> <em>52
        Letters</em>). When he&#8217;s not acting or stage managing, you may
        have run into him at the Aurora Theatre or The Marsh in Berkeley, where
        he House Manages, or in a diversity training workshop with Berkeley
        Interactive Theater, where he serves as company playwright. When Louel
        is not doing theater, you can often find him equipped with foam weapons,
        playing Amtgard or Jugger. Or maybe you&#8217;ve never seen him before?
        In that case, you can check out <a
