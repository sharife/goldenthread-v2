          #### "Thank you so much for the best educational program our school
          has had in years...


          "The beautiful messages and cultural awareness in story form is really
          special! Live theatre is lacking in our elementary education-thank you
          again for filling in this void in such a lovely and powerful way."
          *—Teacher, Daniel Webster Elementary School*


          "Golden Thread has quickly become a favorite presenter of family
          programs at San Francisco Public Library."  *—Family Engagement
          Services, San Francisco Public Library*


          "The students enjoyed the ingenious way the actors changed their
          parts. The kids went around mimicking the actors for days." *—Teacher,
          Hawes Elementary*


          "I’m so happy these kids are getting such wonderful exposure to Middle
          Eastern culture, and especially getting to hear the Palestinian voice.
          And to end it with one of my family’s favorite Fairuz songs was the
          cherry on top!" *—Parent, Berkwood Hedge School*


          "\[As an educator, I valued] an opportunity for students to experience
          art especially made by people of color and performers. *—Teacher,
          Cesar Chavez Elementary School*


          "Inspirational. It would be wonderful to bring it to all elementary
          schools." *—President, Berkeley PTA Council*
