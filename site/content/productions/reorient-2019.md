  ReOrient 2019 celebrates the 20th anniversary of this innovative and spirited
  festival of short plays from or about the Middle East. The line-up includes
  playwrights with longtime association with Golden Thread: Egyptian-American
  playwright Yussef El Guindi, Bay Area-based Palestinian-American playwright
  Betty Shamieh, and MacArthur Fellow and celebrated playwright Naomi Wallace.
  Joining these writers are four newcomers to the festival: Iraqi-British writer
  and actor Rendah Heywood, Noor Theatre Founding Artistic Director Lameece
  Issaq, Turkish-Kurdish writer and filmmaker Mustafa Kaymak, and local
  Iranian-American writer Niku Sharei. Selected from 108 submissions from 13
  countries, the seven short plays are diverse in content and style,
  highlighting the multiplicity of Middle Eastern perspectives and identities.


  “Humanity is at the core of ReOrient. **If theatre is community, it starts here.** If the goal of theatre is to expand our viewpoint, to enrich our knowledge, and to embrace empathy, then ReOrient hugely succeeds.” *—Stark Insider*

This year’s ReOrient Festival marks our second collaboration with the [Literary Managers and Dramaturgs of the Americas (LMDA)](https://lmda.org/). The partnership brings together two organizations that value challenging cultural preconceptions through provocative programming and dialogue. Curated by LMDA’s Regional VP Metro Bay Area and Festival Lead Dramaturg Nakissa Etemad, LMDA is providing a team of Dramaturgs to aid the playwrights in script development, provide contextual information, and write feature articles that peek behind-the-scenes of ReOrient. In addition to Golden Thread resident artist Nakissa Etemad, this year’s Dramaturgy Team includes Emily DeDakis, Laura Espino, Scott Horstein, and Michael Malek Najjar.
