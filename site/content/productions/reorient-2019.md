  ReOrient 2019 will celebrate the 20th anniversary of this innovative and
  spirited festival of short plays from or about the Middle East. The line-up
  includes playwrights with longtime association with Golden Thread:
  Egyptian-American playwright Yussef El Guindi, Bay Area-based
  Palestinian-American playwright Betty Shamieh, and MacArthur Fellow and
  celebrated playwright Naomi Wallace. Joining these writers are four newcomers
  to the festival: Iraqi-British writer and actor Rendah Heywood, Noor Theatre
  Founding Artistic Director Lameece Issaq, Turkish-Kurdish writer and filmmaker
  Mustafa Kaymak, and local Iranian-American writer Niku Sharei. Selected from
  108 submissions from 13 countries, the seven short plays are diverse in
  content and style, highlighting the multiplicity of Middle Eastern
  perspectives and identities.


  “Humanity is at the core of ReOrient. **If theatre is community, it starts here.** If the goal of theatre is to expand our viewpoint, to enrich our knowledge, and to embrace empathy, then ReOrient hugely succeeds.” _—Stark Insider_

This year’s ReOrient Festival marks our second collaboration with the [Literary Managers and Dramaturgs of the Americas (LMDA)](https://lmda.org/). The partnership brings together two organizations that value challenging cultural preconceptions through provocative programming and dialogue. Curated by LMDA’s Regional VP Metro Bay Area and Festival Lead Dramaturg Nakissa Etemad, LMDA is providing a team of Dramaturgs to aid the playwrights in script development, provide contextual information, and write feature articles that peek behind-the-scenes of ReOrient. In addition to Golden Thread resident artist Nakissa Etemad, this year’s Dramaturgy Team includes Emily DeDakis, Laura Espino, Scott Horstein, and Michael Malek Najjar.
