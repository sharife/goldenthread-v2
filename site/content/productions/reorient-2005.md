          In this comedy, four Armenian young men congregate at the men's room
          of a hotel to lament their friend's decision to marry a non-Armenian.
          They chastise his lack of commitment to the preservation of Armenian
          heritage while fantasizing about spending the night with the
          bridesmaids.


          In 1979, at the age of twelve, **Shahe Mankerian** found himself digesting a new language in the Pasadena Unified School District. Away from the Civil War of Lebanon, Shahe began experimenting with written dialogue, both in poetic and dramatic form. Soon after graduating high school, he wrote and staged three plays dealing with a generation of Armenians lost in America. *Teenage Wasteland*, *Youthquaker*, and *The Devil’s Children*, comprised a trilogy of dramatic angst against the melting pot of America. During this period of productivity, Mankerian also published a collection of verse entitled *Children of Honey*.

      bio: >-
        Lenin El Ramly is an "Independent" writer of plays for stage, film and
        television. He is not employed by, nor does he receive funding from, any
        governmental or non-governmental entity.


        Lenin El Ramly was born in Cairo, Egypt on August 18, 1945. His parents were involved in the press and politics as he was growing up.Mr. El Ramly's first short story was published in the magazine Sabah El Kheir in 1956. In 1970 he obtained a bachelor's degree from the High Institute of Theatrical Art, specializing in critique and theatrical literature.In 1967, while still a student, Mr. El Ramly began writing socio-comic plays and series for television. These plays and series acquired popularity and are still broadcast in Egypt to this day.


        In 1971 Mr. El Ramly began writing for the cinema by cooperating with the famous Egyptian film director Salah Abu Seif. After being censored for 25 years the film was produced in 2002 under the title of *The Ostrich and the Peacock*.Mr. El Ramly went on to write twelve scripts for the cinema, three of them with Salah Abu Seif, including *The Beginning* which won the audience award at the Vivay Film Festival for Comic Films in 1987. In 1994 Mr. El Ramly wrote the film *The Terrorist*, which was considered as the first artistic challenge against terrorism in Egypt. In 1974 Mr. El Ramly began to acquire popularity as a playwright. Since then, a year hasn't pass where at least one of his plays hasn't been performed.To date, Mr. El Ramly has had 38 plays (including 5 short plays) performed in the private theatres of Egypt, and also by amateur theatres, colleges, troupes, and cultural centers throughout the country. Many of Mr. El Ramly's plays have also been performed internationally in Jordan, Lebanon, Tunisia, Libya, Qatar, UAE, Iraq, Kuwait, France, and Australia.


        In 1980 Mr. El Ramly founded a troupe called Studio 80. His aim was to present plays that differed from the mainstream of commercial theatre. This troupe performed six of his plays including,*The Hesitant One, You Are Free, The Uncivilized, Hallucinations, A Point of View,* and *In Plain Arabic*. *In Plain Arabic* gained the attention of the world press including The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Herald Tribune, and other leading magazines and newspapers in England, France, Germany, Switzerland, Holland, and Japan. The Encyclopedia of Egyptian Theatre praised *In Plain Arabic*, stating that it discussed profound subjects concerning Arab reality in a sharp and daring way. In 1993, the Foreigner's Press Club in Cairo organized a conference to discuss *In Plain Arabic*, followed in 1997 by another meeting to discuss all of the author's works. Unfortunately, *In Plain Arabic,* as predicted by many correspondents, was never performed outside Egypt. Tunisia refused to allow its performance although it was scheduled to represent Egypt in the Carthage Theatre Festival.


        In 1989 the National State Theatre presented Mr. El Ramly's play *Welcome Beys*,*Goodbye Beys*in 1997*,*and *Would You Like to See a Tragedy?* in 2003. *Welcome Beys* gained unique success by garnering the highest income rates ever at the State Theatre, which opened in the 1930's.*Welcome Beys* also represented Egypt in the Theatre Festival in Baghdad, Carthage Theatre Festival, and also in upper Egypt, where theatre is rarely performed.


        The state owned Comedy Theatre presented *A Ghost for Every Citizen* in 1988,*Hopefully All is Well* in 1997, and *Saalouk Wins a Million* in 2003.


        In 1993 Mr. El Ramly founded another theatre troupe called Studio 2000. Under Studio 2000, Mr. El Ramly wrote and produced a number of theatrical plays including,*The Incident, The Headach, Human Madness, The Secrets of Canded Camera, Wisen Up Doctor,* and *Adam and Eve*. He also wrote short experimental plays, including *The Nightmare*(1993),*The Shame*(1994),*Glory and Misery*(1994),*The Thing*(2000), and *We All Want a Photograph*(2000). In Dec. 2002 his play *The Prisoner* was performed in Danish, in Denmark by the Betty Nansen Theatre Troupe, and directed by the Allan Lydyard. Mr. El Ramly is credited with 23 published long plays in addition to 11 short plays published in magazines.


        A number of Mr. El Ramly's plays have been translated into many different languages. *In Plain Arabic* and *A Point of View* were translated into English*.* *The Prisoner, The Nightmare,*and *The Shame* were translated into French. *Saadoun the Mad Man*has been translated into Hebrew. And *The Prisoner* has also been translated into Danish.


        Mr. El Ramly has also published a number of articles in Egyptian newspapers and magazines. Two of them have been collected and published into books (*Hasawy's Tales*and*Brain Scratching.*)


        Mr. El Ramly traveled to the United States in November 1999 to overlook the filming of his play *Hello America!* which discusses the relationship between Egypt and the United States.He then flew to the United States again in September 2000 as part of an International Visitors Program. During this time he was acquainted with the operations of small theatres in 5 different states.


        In April 2005 Mr. El Ramly will travel to Greece for a performance of*A Peace of Women*, his adaptation of Aristophanes' *Lysistrata*, which he has also directed. This will make *A Peace of Women* the first Arab play to be performed in Greece.


        In April 2005 Mr. El Ramly will be participating in the international conference of comparative Comedy ("Cultural Varieties in Arabic and Western Theatre"), which is to take place in Morocco under the joint auspices of Abdelmalek Essaadi University (Morocco) and the University of Amsterdam.


        Lenin El Ramly's name is included in the National Encyclopedia (1992,) which includes entries on distinguished Egyptian figures in the field of literature.The Dictionary of Egyptian Theatre has described Lenin El Ramly as a famous contemporary comic writer with a rich quantity of productions. The contents of his plays deal with social matters in a sarcastic manner, and often with touches of irony.
