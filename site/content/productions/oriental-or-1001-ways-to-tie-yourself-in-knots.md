Kaan has been commissioned to make an adaptation of 1001 Nights from a Very Important Theater Company, and asked to bring his immigrant, Muslim, queer perspective to it. Unfortunately, he is not sure what all that means. As his characters revolt and refuse to tell the stories that he requires of them, can Kaan face his demons, change the minds and hearts of his audience, and save all the women of the kingdom in the process? Oriental is an absurdist look at the hilarious knots SWANA creatives must tie themselves in to tell their stories and make a career in the American theatre.
