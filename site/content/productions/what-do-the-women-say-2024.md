        considered a classic in Palestinian literature.  Its reach and sales
        have made Abulhawa the most widely read Palestinian author.  Her second
        novel, *The Blue Between Sky and Water* (Bloomsbury, 2015), was likewise
        an international bestseller.  *Against the Loveless World* was published
        in August 2020 by Simon & Schuster to much acclaim.  She is also the
        author of a poetry collection, *My Voice Sought The Wind* (Just World

        multidisciplinary artist: a theatre director, theatre maker, producer,

        as a director and music director in partnership with San Francisco

        first musical, "Morning in Jenin Musical", a Palestinian refugee story
        adapted from the internationally best-selling novel by the same name by
        Susan Abulhawa. After many years hiatus from acting, Bisharat
        is thrilled to be returning to her roots this year to play the role of

        Bisharat is also a photographer with her own arts-focused photography company, capturing the magic of professional dance, theater, and music performances for groups like Yerba Buena Gardens Festival, Sarah Bush Dance Project, and Alonzo King Lines Ballet. Bisharat believes in the transformative power of art and storytelling whether on a stage, in a photograph, or in the stories we tell ourselves.

    - bio: "**Souad Faisal Amin** is a Palestinian activist, artist, and fashion
        designer based in Beirut, Lebanon. In 1985, she earned her Master's
        degree in Food Technology and Nutrition from the American University of
        Beirut but her passion for the arts led her to pursue a Bachelor of Fine
        Arts degree from the Lebanese American University in 2000, followed by
        Fashion Design classes at Esmode between 2005 and 2007. Between 2002 and
        2012, Souad dedicated her time and skills to volunteering in Palestinian
        refugee camps in Lebanon with different non-governmental organizations.
        She also served on the Board of Directors of LOYAC, a Kuwaiti NGO
        working in Lebanon to empower youth through various projects and
        initiatives. In 2012, Souad took a significant step in her advocacy
        journey by founding *Threads of Belonging*, an initiative aimed at
        celebrating Palestinian cultural identity and promoting women’s
        empowerment within the refugee communities. To date, *Threads of
        Belonging* has employed more than 80 women, who produce hundreds of
        handmade pieces reflecting the rich Palestinian cultural heritage
        through thousands of stitches that tell stories of resilience and
        tradition."

      bio: "**THREADS OF BELONGING** originated in 2011 when it started as an order
        for traditionally embroidered tablecloths for a Palestinian wedding.
        Over time, it evolved into an empowerment initiative inspiring women in
        Southern Lebanon's Palestinian refugee camps to express their talent and
        creativity through the timeless art of Palestinian embroidery. What
        initially served as a means to support refugee families with extra
        income transformed into a creative endeavor, bringing joy and pride to
        the participants in the project through a celebration of this ancient
        Palestinian art and heritage. Thus, *Threads of Belonging* was born.
        *Threads of Belonging* introduces innovative motifs, compositions, and
        novel color combinations in cutting-edge clothing designs. Each
        meticulously crafted piece bears the unique signature of its
        embroiderer, concealing within its every stitch a longing for a home
        that will never die."

      bio: "**Eman Al Farra** was born in Gaza and moved to the Bay Area during the
        ceasefire in Gaza in November 2023. She raised five children between
        Gaza, Cairo and Riyadh. Her dedication to her family saw her children
        earn scholarships to study abroad, a testament to her belief in
        education for a better future. Beyond her family, she dedicated her time
        to women's empowerment in Gaza, providing resources for crafts like
        embroidery, helping women build independent lives through their
        artistry. In the United States, she continues to inspire by sharing her
        culinary heritage, catering traditional foods that tell stories of her
        homeland. Her journey embodies the spirit of resilience and empowerment,
        making her a beacon of hope and inspiration on this Women's Day."

        **Christina Harb**, **Leila Mire**, **Basma**, **Wassim Hage**, **Linda
        Zaro**, **Monica McCown**. Al-Juthoor ("Roots" in Arabic) of the Arab
        Diaspora is a Dabkeh troupe that raises awareness about Arab and
        Palestinian struggle, culture, and art. We empower our community and
        youth to take pride in our heritage, our past, and our future by
        honoring our history and celebrating our resistance. Across the borders
        of our diaspora, we assert our community’s connection to our deep roots
        in the land and the people throughout the Arab world, from Iraq,
        Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, and Palestine. 

        Our culture and very existence has become inseparable from resistance to colonialism and state violence. Dabkeh is more than just a celebratory event – its every movement is an ode to our Martyrs, a salute to our resistance fighters and political prisoners, and an expression of our will toward our collective liberation. Al-Juthoor is the soul of the dispossessed awaiting their return to their homes, olive groves, villages, and to their land. With each stomp that shakes the earth, we seek to send tremors to those that oppress us. The art of dabkeh celebrates our resistance, asserts our rage against occupation, and demonstrates our commitment to liberation while reminding the world that we are resilient and steadfast. Our people and our land will be free. WE SHALL RETURN!
