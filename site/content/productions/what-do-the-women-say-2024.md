This year's edition of our annual celebration of International Women’s Day, *What Do the Women Say? 2024: Expressions of Joy* celebrates the resilience and richness of Palestinian traditions and culture through the works of Palestinian women artists. 

It features Palestinian melodies sung by the Aswat ensemble in an homage to the legacy of revered Palestinian activist, leader, and guardian of Palestinian culture and community in the Bay Area, **Nabila Mango**; an excerpt reading from *Where Can I Find Someone Like You, Ali?* a play by Raeda Taha; a traditional Palestinian dabke dance performance by **Al-Juthoor**, a Palestinian Levantine Arab dabke troupe in the San Francisco Bay Area; and a selection of material from the musical *Mornings in Jenin*, a work-in-progress written and composed by multidisciplinary artist **Amal Bisharat**, based on the international bestseller novel by Palestinian renowned author **Susan Abulhawa**. The program concludes with a conversation featuring the artists facilitated by Golden Thread Executive Artistic Director **Sahar Assaf**. 

This year’s celebration also offers traditional Palestinian food for purchase and a showcase of the art of tatreez (traditional Palestinian embroidery) from “Threads for Belonging”, curated by **Souad Amine**, a Palestinian artist based in Lebanon, starting at 6:30 pm in the lobby before the show. 

A highly anticipate annual offering, Golden Thread Productions celebrates International Women’s Day with *What Do the Women Say?*, which showcases the work of leading Middle Eastern women artists. Previous programs have focused on dismantling patriarchy, the resilience of Syrian women who build community through their art, and artists who explore sex and sexuality.
