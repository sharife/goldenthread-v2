The 2024 edition of our annual celebration of International Women’s Day, What Do the Women Say?: Expressions of Joy will celebrate the resilience and richness of Palestinian traditions and culture through the works of Palestinian women artists. 

It will feature Palestinian melodies sung by the Aswat ensemble in an homage to the legacy of revered Palestinian activist, leader, and guardian of Palestinian culture and community in the Bay Area, Nabila Mango; an excerpt reading from Where do I find someone like you, Ali? a play by Raeda Taha; a traditional Palestinian dabke dance performance by Al-Juthoor, a Palestinian Levantine Arab dabke troupe in the SF Bay Area; and a selection of material from the musical Mornings in Jenin, a work-in-progress written and composed by multidisciplinary artist Amal Bisharat, based on the international bestseller novel by Palestinian renowned author Susan Abulhawa. The program concludes with a conversation featuring the artists facilitated by Golden Thread Executive Artistic Director Sahar Assaf. 

This year’s celebration will also offer traditional Palestinian food for purchase and a showcase of the art of tatreez (traditional Palestinian embroidery) from “Threads for Belonging”, curated by Souad Amine, a Palestinian artist based in Lebanon, starting at 6:30 pm in the lobby before the show. 

Presented in a hybrid format with artists appearing in-person and virtually. Audiences can join in person or online.
