        Al-Juthoor company members are **Zaynah Hindi**, **Yasmeen Odeh**,
        **Christina Harb**, **Leila Mire**, **Basma**, **Wassim Hage**, **Linda
        Zaro**, **Monica McCown**. Al-Juthoor ("Roots" in Arabic) of the Arab
        Diaspora is a Dabkeh troupe that raises awareness about Arab and
        Palestinian struggle, culture, and art. We empower our community and
        youth to take pride in our heritage, our past, and our future by
        honoring our history and celebrating our resistance. Across the borders
        of our diaspora, we assert our community’s connection to our deep roots
        in the land and the people throughout the Arab world, from Iraq,
        Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, and Palestine. 

        Our culture and very existence has become inseparable from resistance to colonialism and state violence. Dabkeh is more than just a celebratory event – its every movement is an ode to our Martyrs, a salute to our resistance fighters and political prisoners, and an expression of our will toward our collective liberation. Al-Juthoor is the soul of the dispossessed awaiting their return to their homes, olive groves, villages, and to their land. With each stomp that shakes the earth, we seek to send tremors to those that oppress us. The art of dabkeh celebrates our resistance, asserts our rage against occupation, and demonstrates our commitment to liberation while reminding the world that we are resilient and steadfast. Our people and our land will be free. WE SHALL RETURN!
