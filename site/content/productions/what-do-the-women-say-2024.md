**What Do the Women Say? 2024: Expressions of Joy** features Palestinian melodies sung by the Aswat ensemble in an homage to the legacy of revered Palestinian activist, leader, and guardian of Palestinian culture and community in the Bay Area, **Nabila Mango**; an excerpt reading from *Where Can I Find Someone Like You, Ali?* a play by Raeda Taha; a traditional Palestinian dabke dance performance by **Al-Juthoor**, a Palestinian Levantine Arab dabke troupe in the San Francisco Bay Area; and a selection of material from the musical *Mornings in Jenin*, a work-in-progress written and composed by multidisciplinary artist **Amal Bisharat**, based on the international bestseller novel by Palestinian renowned author **Susan Abulhawa**. The program concludes with a conversation featuring the artists facilitated by Golden Thread Executive Artistic Director **Sahar Assaf**. 

This year’s celebration also offers traditional Palestinian food for purchase and a showcase of the art of tatreez (traditional Palestinian embroidery) from “Threads for Belonging”, curated by **Souad Amine**, a Palestinian artist based in Lebanon, starting at 6:30 pm in the lobby before the show. 

The program is presented in a hybrid format with artists appearing in-person and virtually. Audiences can join in person or online.
