  We're thrilled to announce the long awaited U.S. Premiere of *The Language of
  Wild Berries* by **Naghmeh Samini** in a new English-language translation by
  **Torange Yeghiazarian**. 


  Donya and Davood celebrate their wedding anniversary by traveling to the same sea side town where they spent their honeymoon. But on this trip, their 10th anniversary, a mysterious young man is following them. Who is he? What does he want? Trying to solve the mystery of the young man throws Donya and Davood into a time warp recalling their past nine anniversary trips. They remember what they have forgotten. But will that be enough to save their marriage? The past, present, and future collide in **Naghmeh Samini**’s touching play, offering a rare glimpse into the lives of contemporary Iranians.


  In 2020, Golden Thread's planned production of *The Language of Wild Berries* was postponed due to the coronavirus and we produced an audio recording of the play instead. Watch the very first episode of our digital series NO SUMMARY: Conversations with Artists Who Don't Fit in a Box, which featured **Naghmeh Samini** and **Torange Yeghiazarian** in conversation on October 7, 2020, to learn more.\

  In September 2022, our 17th episode of NO SUMMARY: Conversations with Artists Who Don't Fit in a Box features the cast of our 2022 production: **Zaya Kolia**, **Damien Seperi**, **Dina Zarif**.
