  Struggling writer Gamal hates the way his fellow Arab-Americans represent
  their culture on American media. It’s easy enough to take out his frustration
  on literature superstar Mohsen and local mosque leader, Sheikh Alfani. But
  when his own girlfriend and novelist Noor gets an offer from a major publisher
  backed with a national media campaign, how will Gamal manage his frustration?


  Award-winning Egyptian-American playwright Yussef El Guindi holds the honor of being the most produced writer at Golden Thread. El Guindi has won the Steinberg/American Theater Critics Association’s New Play Award in 2012, and was the recipient of the 2010 Middle East America Distinguished Playwright Award. His previous premieres with the company include *Language Rooms*, *Jihad Jones and the Kalashnikov Babes*, *Back of the Throat*, *Scenic Routes*, and many shorts in ReOrient Festivals. Golden Thread performed El Guindi’s *Karima’s City* at the Cairo International Festival for Experimental Theatre in 2004.

**HIGHEST RATING!**\
“Smart, daring and well constructed… For a play about ideas, the kind of urgent ideas that don’t make it to American stages often enough, its debaters are just as complex and fleshed out as the ideas themselves.” — *San Francisco Chronicle* [(read full review)](http://www.sfgate.com/performance/article/Enemies-you-want-to-get-close-to-10429039.php)

“**Powerful, unforgettable theatre**… There’s sex, deep rumination, harsh conflict, galvanizing anger, violence, manipulation, lying, fierce intelligence, incisive criticism and genuine affection. Director Torange Yeghiazarian and her tremendous actors throw the conversation wide open and invite the audience to be active participants in the drama.” —*Theater Dogs* [(read full review)](http://www.theaterdogs.net/2016/11/07/making-friends-with-golden-threads-enemies/)

“**FIVE STARS! El Guindi ‘s command of dramatic construction is superb.** He layers event upon event until the jigsaw puzzle is dramatically complete with more than a soupcon of satirical humor and a dollop of sex.” —*Theatre World* [(read full review)](http://forallevents.info/reviews/a-dynamic-our-enemies-lively-scene-of-love-and-combat-lives-up-to-its-title-at-the-thick-house/)

“**A gripping drama**…*Our Enemies* exposes the futility of using group affiliation to decide that basic question: Who speaks for me? Who is a “genuine” Arab? A “genuine” Muslim? Or, for that matter, a “genuine” American? Answers don’t come easily.” —*Pacific Sun* [(read full review)](http://pacificsun.com/theater-identity-question/)

It was refreshing to have a show give voice to **so many nuanced and authentic perspectives**, while still being entertaining. ” —*Mission Mission* [(read full review)](http://www.missionmission.org/2016/11/10/drama-talk-drinks-our-enemies-lively-scenes-of-love-and-combat-it-was-refreshing/)

“**A powerful piece of political theatre** brought to life by a superb ensemble through Yeghiazarian’s deft stage direction.” —*Huffington Post* [(read full review)](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/theres-got-to-be-a-morning-after_us_58265e89e4b02b1f5257a1ee)

“**BEST OF 2016**: The other company in residence at Thick House that dazzled is Golden Thread Productions, whose *Our Enemies* by Yussef El Guindi delivered action and depth in its exploration of what it means, among other things, to be Muslim in this country.” —*Bay Area Reporter* [(read full review)](http://www.ebar.com/arts/art_article.php?sec=theatre&article=1316)
