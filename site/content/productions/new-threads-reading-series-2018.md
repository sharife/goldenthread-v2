        text: >-
          “What binds us is stronger than sex. It is stronger than love.”


          It is May 2001 in Cairo. Moody, Khalid, and their servant Taha are on the Queen Boat, a gay nightclub docked on the Nile. When an unexpected police raid results in the arrest and public humiliation of the attendees, the lives of these young men are altered forever. Recent NYU Abu Dhabi graduate Adam Ashraf Elsayigh weaves budding romances, class differences, and familial expectations into a loving portrait of three men who all struggle to rebuild their lives against all odds.


          featuring **Amin El Gamal***, **Mostafa Elmorsy**, **Islam Meligi**, and **Mohamed Rashad**; stage management by **Benjamin Shiu**

          “Painting is a job! No, I’m not getting paid.”


          San Francisco has become the playground of the young and the ambitious. But can 20-somethings Marc, Yosef, and Ellie continue to pursue their creative dreams while battling the city’s new ruthless startup culture? Bay Area-based Iraqi-Assyrian American playwright Edessa Tailo sets her beautiful new play on the rooftop of an Outer Richmond apartment building with the city’s signature fog as its backdrop.


          featuring **Shoresh Alaudini**, **Danya El-Kurd**, **Grace Ng**, **Emily Serdahl***, **Mohammad Shehata***, and **Aaron Wilton***; stage management by **Sarah Gasser**

        title: FIELD, AWAKENING
        text: >-
          “Have you seen my Mama? Big ol’ she-wolf. You’d know a she-wolf if you
          saw one, believe you me. Your leader, she was.”


          Rana is back in Istanbul after ten years of self-imposed exile from her homeland. Reunited with three old friends on a soccer field, she fast becomes aware of how much has changed and how much has stayed exactly the same. Set on the night of the 2016 Turkish coup attempt, Turkish-American writer Melis Aker’s *Field, Awakening* is a bittersweet meditation on friendship and nostalgia in the face of political turmoil.


          featuring **Rotimi Agbabiaka***, **Atosa Babaoff***, **Aysan Celik***, **Garth Petal***, **Salim Razawi**, and **Vaho**; stage management by **Kenan Arun**

          *“A fence like this has nothing harmful about it, nothing threatening,
          nothing ideological. It can be considered as a work of environmental
          art.”*


          Commercials tout new security devices like migrant heartbeat detectors. Desperate migrants pay with their organs for passage across the sea. A president works with a consultant to hone his anti-immigrant message. And if the boat is too heavy, how will the audience decide who must be thrown overboard? Adapted and directed by Iranian writer, director, and multimedia artist Nima Dehghani, *Migraaaants* is an immersive experience that is dark, absurd, and surprisingly funny.


          featuring **Safinah Chau**, **Alborz Ghandehari**, **Douglas B. Giorgis***, **Zaya Kolia**, **Carolina Morones**, **Matin Nasiriha**, **Lawrence Radecker***, **Mohamed Rashad**, **Marjan Safa**, **Kenny Scott**, **Damien Seperi***, **Ayla Yarkut***, and **Bella Warda**; stage management by **Benjamin Shiu**
