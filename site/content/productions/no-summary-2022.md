        title: "Critiquing the Critics: the Reception of MENA Productions"
        text: >-
          Golden Thread invites **Sarah Fahmy**, a scholar and devising artist
          to moderate a conversation on the reception of MENA productions in the
          U.S. today with **Kareem Fahmy**, a theatre director, playwright, and
          screenwriter whose work is produced at nationally acclaimed theatre
          companies this year, and **Malek Najjar**, a director, playwright, and
          scholar of Arab American and Middle-Eastern American theatre and
          Associate Professor of Theatre Arts at the University of Oregon. When
          Middle Eastern North African stories are constantly subjected to the
          white gaze and are performed in front of a predominantly white-US
          audience, how do MENA creative teams grapple with an authentic
          representation of their artistry, languages, and cultures?


          This conversation is produced and hosted by Golden Thread Productions in collaboration with the MENATMA Convening taking place at the Arab American National Museum, November 10-12, 2022.

          trauma-informed therapist to host a conversation with *Drowning in
          Cairo’s* Intimacy Coordinator **Maya Herbsman** and Fight
          Director **Carla Pantoja**. When violence, abuse and intimate content
          are part of the storytelling, how can we ensure safety and protection
          in the rehearsal room and the performance space? Maya and Carla will
          discuss their creative process and their role in safely driving the
          story forward. The artists will offer us insights into the protocols
          of touch and contact between actors and how such protocols affirm
          trust and creativity.
