          Facilitated by **Kholoud Nasser** and featuring **Maya Herbsman**,
          and **Carla Pantoja**.


          Golden Thread invites **Kholoud Nasser**, a theatre artist and trauma-informed therapist to host a conversation with *Drowning in Cairo’s* Intimacy Coordinator **Maya Herbsman** and Fight Director **Carla Pantoja**. When violence, abuse and intimate content are part of the storytelling, how can we ensure safety and protection in the rehearsal room and the performance space? Maya and Carla will discuss their creative process and their role in safely driving the story forward. The artists will offer us insights into the protocols of touch and contact between actors and how such protocols affirm trust and creativity.

          Yousif Zebari** and **Wiley Naman Strasser** and learn about their
