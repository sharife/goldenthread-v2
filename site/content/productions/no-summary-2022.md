        title: Featuring the cast of Drowning in Cairo by Adam Ashraf Elsayigh
        text: >-
          Golden Thread's Executive Artistic Director **Sahar Assaf** introduces
          and interviews the cast members of *Drowning in Cairo*, a world
          premiere by Adam Ashraf Elsayigh. The play focuses on the lives of
          three young men whose lives are forever altered when an unexpected
          police raid results in the arrest and public humiliation of the
          attendees of the Queen Boat, a gay nightclub docked on the Nile. Come
          meet **Martin Yousif Zebari** and **Wiley Naman Strasser** and learn
          about their theatre journeys and what excites them about this debut
          production coming up in April 2022 at Golden Thread.
