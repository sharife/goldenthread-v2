          Akbarzadeh,** hosts a panel of arts, culture, and education
          professionals to discuss Golden Thread’s theatre for young audiences
          program. In this particular moment of divisive politics, and as we

          from bringing Middle Eastern storytelling to young audiences?

          costume designer), **Sabria Hassan** (program manager with the
          American Association of Yemeni Students and Professionals),
          and **Angela Norton Tyler** (teacher at Fruitvale Elementary School in
          Oakland, CA) as they discuss the production and reception of Fairytale
          Players’ 2022 tour of *Nasrudin’s Magnificent Journey to
          Samarkand*, written by Torange Yeghiazarian and directed by Sarah

        text: Golden Thread invites **Kholoud Nasser**, a theatre artist and
          trauma-informed therapist to host a conversation with *Drowning in
          Cairo’s* Intimacy Coordinator **Maya Herbsman** and Fight
          Director **Carla Pantoja**. When violence, abuse and intimate content
          are part of the storytelling, how can we ensure safety and protection
          in the rehearsal room and the performance space? Maya and Carla will
          discuss their creative process and their role in safely driving the
          story forward. The artists will offer us insights into the protocols
          of touch and contact between actors and how such protocols affirm
          trust and creativity.
