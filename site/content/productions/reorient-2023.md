          to share. It is not a pretty stream of consciousness.

          This year’s ReOrient Festival marks our third collaboration with the
          [Literary Managers and Dramaturgs of the Americas
          (LMDA)](https://lmda.org/). The partnership brings together two

          provocative programming and dialogue, and is curated by LMDA’s
          Regional VP Metro Bay Area and Festival Lead Dramaturg Nakissa Etemad.
          The ReOrient Dramaturgy Team consists of a team of professional
          dramaturgs who bring their expertise in new play development,
          research, contextualization, and theatre writing. This year’s
          partnership augments the team to include a Publications Dramaturg to
          join the ReOrient Camp & Festival and write a feature article on
          ReOrient artists and the creative process that brings audiences
          behind-the-scenes (see link below, or read it at
          [lmda.org](https://lmda.org/reorient-2023-festival)). Be sure to check
          out the Dramaturgs’ program notes and playwright messages curated by
          the team in the [Festival
          Program](https://www.flipsnack.com/goldenthread/reorient_2023_program_final/full-view.html)! 


          In addition to Golden Thread resident artist **Nakissa Etemad**, the ReOrient 2023 Dramaturgy Team includes **Marina Johnson**, **Vidhu Singh**, and **Heather Rastovac Akbarzadeh**.
