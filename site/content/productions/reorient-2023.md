        subtitle: by Yussef El Guindi
        text: Ahmed is waiting in an immigration line as his thoughts race, skid, and
          trip him up as he anticipates the things that might be asked, the
          papers he’ll have to show, and the personal information he might have
          to share. It is not a pretty stream of consciousness.

        subtitle: by Hamed Sinno
        text: In a farce of a play within a play within a play, fractals of a writer’s
          identity battle over controlling the narrative. When they start
          eliminating each other, it becomes unclear who is writing whom.

        text: Discovering a pile of dead bodies in the middle of their office, work
          colleagues seem nonchalant to the carnage and instead become embroiled
          in petty arguments. Their repetitive discussions and responses are
          predetermined and non-negotiable.

        text: Lebanese Gen-Z Partyboi Sam is in trouble with his tamer, older, White
          boyfriend Joel. But it's really not his fault Joel went snooping,
          finding Sam's FUCK FORM, with all the raunchy descriptions of his
          recent hookups. So here they are at ODYSSEY, San Francisco's hottest,
          new Couple Therapy practice. Will Sam and Joel manage to fix this hot
          mess with the assistance of their overwhelmed but well-meaning
          counselor, Sharon... or is this all doomed for failure?
