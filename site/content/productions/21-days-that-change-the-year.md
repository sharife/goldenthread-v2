      - text: '"Golden Thread Fairytale Players performance was an extremely fun and
          engaging way to teach young children about a different culture. It was
          especially impactful on my students, since one of them was leaving for
          Afghanistan the following day and was not aware of her family
          traditions." -McGill School, Redwood City'
      - text: '"The Golden Thread Fairytale Players program was excellent. The students
          enjoyed the ingenious way the actors changed their parts. The kids
          went around mimicking the actors for days, especially the older
          woman." -Hawes School, Redwood City'

This delightful performance frames an ancient tale from Ferdowsi’s *Shahnameh* within contemporary adventures of Dara & Sara, a sister and brother eagerly awaiting the coming of *Nowruz*. Guided by their sweet but somewhat hard-of-hearing granny, Dara & Sara learn about spring cleaning, setting a traditional *Haft-seen* table, the fun rituals of *Charshanbeh-suri*, and the *Sizdeh-bedar* picnic which concludes the rite of spring ceremonies. This enriching and humorous presentation includes music, dance, storytelling, puppetry, and audience participation. Fusing history and literature with contemporary arts, ***21 Days That Change the Year*** offers a multi-cultural event providing children and their families with the richness of Middle Eastern arts and culture.
