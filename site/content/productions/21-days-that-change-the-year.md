          engaging way to teach young children about a different culture. It was
          especially impactful on my students, since one of them was leaving for
          Afghanistan the following day and was not aware of her family
          traditions." -McGill School, Redwood City'

This delightful performance frames an ancient tale from Ferdowsi’s *Shahnameh* within contemporary adventures of Dara & Sara, a sister and brother eagerly awaiting the coming of *Nowruz*. Guided by their sweet but somewhat hard-of-hearing granny, Dara & Sara learn about spring cleaning, setting a traditional *Haft-seen* table, the fun rituals of *Charshanbeh-suri*, and the *Sizdeh-bedar* picnic which concludes the rite of spring ceremonies. 

This enriching and humorous presentation includes music, dance, storytelling, puppetry, and audience participation. Fusing history and literature with contemporary arts, ***21 Days That Change the Year*** offers a multi-cultural event providing children and their families with the richness of Iranian arts and culture.
