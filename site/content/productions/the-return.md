      bio: "**Hanna Eady** and **Edward Mast** have been writing plays together since
        they met in Seattle in 1995. Hanna Eady grew up as a Palestinian in
        Northern Israel and had come to Seattle years earlier for graduate
        school in directing. Edward Mast was returning home from his first of
        many trips to the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Their first
        collaboration was *Sahmatah*, a play drawn from testimonies by residents
        of one of the Palestinian villages destroyed during the founding of
        Israel in 1948.  *Sahmatah* premiered in 1996 in Seattle, and then
        premiered in Arabic in 1998 on the original site of the village itself
        inside what is now Israel. Other plays they have written together
        include *Loved Ones: Families of the Incarcerated*, *Letters from
        Palestine in the Time of the Virus*, *The Love Tunnel: A Comedy of
        Occupation*, and *The Mulberry Tree*, which recently premiered in New
        York."

*The Return* was part of New Threads Staged Reading Series in 2024.

*“…a taut and provocative two-character play—which vividly evokes the political tension between the Israeli state and its Palestinian citizens. More than a play to be touched and troubled by. It’s a play to get in the gut.”* – John Stoltenberg, DC Theater Arts 

*“The Return is as much about the Israeli—Palestinian conflict as it is about the repercussions a decades-long occupation can have on the lives of everyday people.”* – South Seattle Emerald
