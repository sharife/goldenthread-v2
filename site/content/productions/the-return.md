      bio: "have been writing plays together since they met in Seattle in 1995. Hanna
        Eady grew up as a Palestinian in Northern Israel and had come to Seattle
        years earlier for graduate school in directing. Edward Mast was
        returning home from his first of many trips to the Occupied Palestinian
        Territories. Their first collaboration was *Sahmatah*, a play drawn from
        testimonies by residents of one of the Palestinian villages destroyed
        during the founding of Israel in 1948.  *Sahmatah* premiered in 1996 in
        Seattle, and then premiered in Arabic in 1998 on the original site of
        the village itself inside what is now Israel. Other plays they have
        written together include *Loved Ones: Families of the Incarcerated*,
        *Letters from Palestine in the Time of the Virus*, *The Love Tunnel: A
        Comedy of Occupation*, and *The Mulberry Tree*, which recently premiered
        in New York."

**PRESS ABOUT *THE RETURN*:**

**For two Palestinian artists, making S.F. theater is resistance**\
﻿"I'm going to say the forbidden word: It's a genocide. \[...] My job, to tell the story, it's an obligation. It's part of 
who I am. I have to continue to bang at the door until my story is heard." --Hanna Eady\
[R﻿ead the full *San Francisco Chronicle* interview with Hanna Eady (*The Return*) and Hend Ayoub (*Home?*)](https://www.sfchronicle.com/entertainment/article/theater-palestinian-san-francisco-20779248.php)

“…a taut and provocative two-character play—which vividly evokes the political tension between the Israeli state and its Palestinian citizens. More than a play to be touched and troubled by. It’s a play to get in the gut.” – John Stoltenberg, DC Theater Arts 

“*The Return* is as much about the Israeli—Palestinian conflict as it is about the repercussions a decades-long occupation can have on the lives of everyday people. I﻿t is a play that has to be watched; it can't be explained or summarized. At least, that's what Eady says. 'I can't tell you too much about the plot, because the way the structure works is that it unfolds as the audience would watch it,' said Eady, adding that it's a mystery." – *South Seattle Emerald*
