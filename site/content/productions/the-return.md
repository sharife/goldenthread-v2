Two people meeting in an auto-body shop in the mid-sized city Herzliya. They might or might not have known each other in the past. One of them is Palestinian, one of them is Israeli Jewish, and by the end of the play, both of their lives will be changed forever by the realities that surround them.

*The Return* has been performed in Haifa, Washington DC, Boston, and Seattle.

**Reviews:**

*“…a taut and provocative two-character play—which vividly evokes the political tension between the Israeli state and its Palestinian citizens. More than a play to be touched and troubled by. It’s a play to get in the gut.”* – John Stoltenberg, DC Theater Arts 

*“The Return is as much about the Israeli—Palestinian conflict as it is about the repercussions a decades-long occupation can have on the lives of everyday people.”* – South Seattle Emerald
