        text: Pulitzer Prize-winning, Lebanese-American journalist [Anthony
          Shadid](https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/anthony-shadid) is wounded in
          Palestine, awaits the American invasion of Iraq in Baghdad, covers the
          Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 2006, the fall of Mubarak in Tahrir
          Square, and is kidnapped in Libya while reporting on the civil war
          there. He re-defined the role of a reporter and was one of the only
          correspondents who covered the lives of people from the Arab world
          from every walk of life.

          by **Nabra Nelson**

          directed by **Susannah Martin**
        text: In the year 2080, the new normal involves taboos on pregnancy, car
          ownership, red meat, and suburban homes. It involves travel
          restrictions, a mixed-race majority, ongoing climate disasters, and
          constant uncertainty. But other than that, everything is the old
          normal. Except for Hoda’s experimental pregnancy. As Hoda gets
          ever-closer to her dream life, things don’t seem to be going as
          planned. An intense yet comedic experience, this near-futuristic play
          simulates the unexpected.

          Afghan American immigrant with a secret. Her tech CEO daughter Maryam
          is struggling with legal woes, while Noor’s nieces, the estranged
          sisters Sosan and Nadia, work to mend their fractured relationship.
          Meanwhile, Fatima, a Black Muslim convert, hopes to find her
          biological mother. Will the journey bring them together, or will
          secrets, rivalries, and old wounds tear them apart?

          Presented in collaboration with Z Space and San Francisco Playhouse.


          Through a panoply of vivid characters—from a five-year-old who just wants to join the neighborhood's Purim party to a casting director in Egypt who can't forget where she comes from, to her dying mother who longs for her to find a place in the world—Hend shares a deeply personal and true story about her search for the place that many of us take for granted: Home.
