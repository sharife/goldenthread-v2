        text: Pulitzer Prize-winning, Lebanese-American journalist Anthony Shadid is
          wounded in Palestine, awaits the American invasion of Iraq in Baghdad,
          covers the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 2006, the fall of Mubarak in
          Tahrir Square, and is kidnapped in Libya while reporting on the civil
          war there. He re-defined the role of a reporter and was one of the
          only correspondents who covered the lives of people from the Arab
          world from every walk of life.

        text: In the year 2080, the new normal involves taboos on pregnancy, car
          ownership, red meat, and suburban homes. It involves travel
          restrictions, a mixed-race majority, ongoing climate disasters, and
          constant uncertainty. But other than that, everything is the old
          normal. Except for Hoda’s experimental pregnancy. As Hoda gets
          ever-closer to her dream life, things don’t seem to be going as
          planned. An intense yet comedic experience, this near-futuristic play
          simulates the unexpected.

          Presented in collaboration with Z Space and San Francisco Playhouse.


          In Israel, she’s a Palestinian. In the Arab world, she's an Israeli. In America, she's an Other. Home? If only she can find it. Through a panoply of vivid characters—from a five-year-old who just wants to join the neighborhood's Purim party to a casting director in Egypt who can't forget where she comes from, to her dying mother who longs for her to find a place in the world—Hend shares a deeply personal and true story about her search for the place that many of us take for granted: Home.

New Threads is Golden Thread’s annual staged reading series that engages its audience in the process of playmaking and allows writers of Middle Eastern and non-Middle Eastern descent an authentic and supportive space to develop work about the Middle East.

Each reading is accompanied by talkbacks with the artists and other experts that explore the themes of the play which enable you to experience the creative process.
