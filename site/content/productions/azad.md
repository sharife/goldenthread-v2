Burdened by a divorce, Osman Kavala’s imprisonment in Turkey, and the ghosts of her past, Sona Tatoyan sets off to create a TV series exploring the Armenian Genocide and Syrian war. Everything changes when she unearths a trunk in her family’s war-torn Aleppo home: Karagöz puppets built by her great-great grandfather! In a quantum entanglement that spans a century, could this be the story she’s been missing: a multigenerational healing journey?
