description: "Burdened by a divorce, Osman Kavala’s imprisonment in Turkey, and
  the ghosts of her past, Sona Tatoyan sets off to create a TV series exploring
  the Armenian Genocide and Syrian war. Everything changes when she unearths a
  trunk in her family’s war-torn Aleppo home: Karagöz puppets built by her
  great-great grandfather! In a quantum entanglement that spans a century, could
  this be the story she’s been missing: a multigenerational healing journey?"

        **Hakawati** is a social justice vehicle working with communities that
        exist on the frontlines of suffering to catalyze radical change.
        Hakawati was founded by Syrian-Armenian-American actress/writer/producer
        Sona Tatoyan. With a passion for storytelling, human rights and
        transformation, Hakawati is driven to use the art of storytelling to
        heal. As a meeting place to witness trauma and support its alchemy
        towards inspiration and creativity, Hakawati aspires to empower the
        seemingly disempowered: to help un-silence the silenced and amplify the
        compassionate humanity of all of us.\


        We provide an empowering platform that facilitates the creative talent of refugees and marginalized people through development labs in film, theater, and other storytelling modalities, along with creating indigenous theater and film productions. Hakawati works with, and employs people from within these local communities whenever possible – to tell stories by people from the places and spaces where the story originates. We work to preserve cultures under threat, mentor artists in frontline communities, and support refugee storytelling within displaced communities.
