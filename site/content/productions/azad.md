  by **Sona Tatoyan** in collaboration with **Jared Mezzocchi**\

  directed by Jared Mezzocchi\

  featuring Sona Tatoyan, a tribe of Karagöz Puppets, and oud player **Ara Dinkjian**


  a﻿ co-production with **Hakawati NGO**


  Syrian-Armenian-American theatre and film artist Sona Tatoyan, stranded in her family’s abandoned Aleppo home during the Syrian war, discovers her great-great-grandfather’s handmade Karagöz shadow puppets, salvaged from the Armenian Genocide. Guided by the storyteller Scherazad, the puppets unveil bawdy, hilarious, and haunting tales that transport Sona through an intergenerational, psychedelic journey, alchemizing a radiant truth: stories, when reimagined, possess the power to transmute trauma to healing.

  **H﻿IGHEST RATING!** \

  **"**﻿The wondrous *AZAD (the rabbit and the wolf)* combines uproarious shadow puppetry with devastating drama about family history. Every aspect of the show’s mise-en-scène hums with synchronicity."  —*San Francisco Chronicle* [(Read full review)](https://www.sfchronicle.com/entertainment/article/azad-golden-thread-review-20265215.php)

          Join us for a special post-show conversation with **Sona Tatoyan** and
          renowned art historian **Heghnar Zeitlian Watenpaugh**, moderated by
          Golden Thread founder and playwright **Torange Yeghiazarian**. This
          talkback will delve into the creative process and thematic
          inspirations behind *AZAD (the rabbit and the wolf)*. Drawing on
          Watenpaugh’s groundbreaking work on “survivor objects”, which she
          defines as “artifacts that have experienced atrocities, even genocide,
          and survived”, the conversation will explore how material culture
          carries the weight of history and resilience, and how both stories and
          objects bear witness to survival.


          Immediately following the matinee performance on Sunday, April 20.

        **Hakawati** is a social justice vehicle working with communities that
        exist on the frontlines of suffering to catalyze radical change.
        Hakawati was founded by Syrian-Armenian-American actress/writer/producer
        Sona Tatoyan. With a passion for storytelling, human rights and
        transformation, Hakawati is driven to use the art of storytelling to
        heal. As a meeting place to witness trauma and support its alchemy
        towards inspiration and creativity, Hakawati aspires to empower the
        seemingly disempowered: to help un-silence the silenced and amplify the
        compassionate humanity of all of us.


        We provide an empowering platform that facilitates the creative talent of refugees and marginalized people through development labs in film, theater, and other storytelling modalities, along with creating indigenous theater and film productions. Hakawati works with, and employs people from within these local communities whenever possible – to tell stories by people from the places and spaces where the story originates. We work to preserve cultures under threat, mentor artists in frontline communities, and support refugee storytelling within displaced communities.
