  Zahra Noorbakhsh flies in from Planet Islam, home of the Muslim world, to
  speak on behalf of her people, all 1.8 whoever-billion of them. Growing up,
  Zahra’s never felt like enough of anything to be speaking on behalf of anyone,
  and most days she doesn’t even feel smart enough to be Muslim! But that’s
  precisely why she’s got this show. In her 15-year career in stand-up, she’s
  been a walking Q&A. So, for two nights in June, she’s taking the stage to
  definitively answer the questions that she has. In her signature inquisitive
  and unapologetic style, Zahra takes us on an adventure you can’t afford to
  miss.


  Following two years of development, Iranian American comedian and co-host of
  internationally acclaimed podcast,
  [\#GoodMuslimBadMuslim](http://www.goodmuslimbadmuslim.com/) – a “must listen”
  by Oprah Magazine – Zahra will perform the world premiere of her hour-long
  comedy special. Directed by Lisa Marie Rollins, one of 10 artists honored by
  [KQED Arts’s Bay
  Brilliant](https://www.kqed.org/arts/13839060/bay-brilliant-lisa-marie-rollins)
  series in 2018, and dramaturgy by Award-winning Iranian American dramaturg,
  Nakissa Etemad.

          On *Fresh Air with Terry Gross*, Zahra remembers a childhood
          experience to find the courage to continue to perform live in the face
          of rising anti-Muslim rhetoric.
