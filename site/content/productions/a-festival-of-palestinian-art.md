          Back by popular demand after a sold-out run in 2023, *AMREEKA 2026:
          The Comedy Show* is a raucous night of stand-up comedy, this year
          featuring an all-Palestinian lineup! Curated by former Golden Thread
          Artist-in-Residence Wafaa Bilal, this unique show brings together 
          comedians with one thing in common: a deep love of complaining. The
          toxic culture and politics in “Amreeka,” as some Middle Easterners
          playfully pronounce it, offer ample fodder for further complaints.
          This cathartic and witty venting holds a mirror up to reality showing
          it has become so absurd and surreal, one must laugh, if not cry.


          For Iraqi artist Wafaa Bilal, the show, just like his solo works, “is an artistic platform for creating dialogue and bringing people together on highly charged topics. Not politicizing laughter but laughing at politics as a form of solidarity and resistance.”

        title: The Horse of Jenin
        text: Built from the debris of a major invasion, the Horse of Jenin sculpture
          became a constant presence in Alaa’s life growing up in Occupied
          Palestine. It stood proudly in the center of the city for twenty
          years, symbolizing hope and resistance. Then, on October 29, 2023, an
          Israeli bulldozer entered the city, ripping the sculpture from its
          place — and from its people. Now, Alaa is left wondering… What
          happened to the horse? This filmed version of Shehada’s brilliant solo
          show combines storytelling, mask, and stand-up comedy, and stands as
          an ode to the power of imagination and the resilience it brings.

        text: A baker, a mystic, and a falcon walk into an office one stormy night…
          Rabia Haddad is on a mission to discover a lost history. But as she
          builds her map, the archive begins to talk back, blurring the lines
          between testimony, memory and myth. Could it be that the one story she
          needs most is her own? A play about inheritance, letting go, and the
          desire to belong to something larger than yourself, *A Country Made of
          Salt* invites us to reflect on the stories we keep — and what stories
          keep us.
