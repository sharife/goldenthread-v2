        subtitle: by **Hassan Abdulrazzak** (London-based, Iraq)
        text: A hard-hitting play by artistic affiliate Hassan Abdulrazzah (*Love,
          Apples, and Bombs*), *Dare Not Speak* focuses on a young child,
          murdered in a genocide, as she pitches her story to a theater artistic
          director who is reluctant to put it on stage.

        subtitle: by **Banafsheh Hassani** (Montreal-based, Iran)
        text: A new solo show Inspired by a true story, the classic Greek tragedy of
          Antigone, war photography, fleeting memories, a revolution, state
          propaganda, a song she sang, and cringe diaspora poetry where “every
          line is a call to action.

        subtitle: by **Sapehr Jafari** (Bay Area-based, Iran)
        text: Two friends develop a weekly ritual of attending the Iranian diaspora
          protests in San Francisco every weekend, to try to prevent their
          countrymen from being executed in the Islamic Republic prisons. But
          their differences become more disastrous with each passing day, and as
          activism takes a toll on them, it takes everything they got to not
          murder each other.

        subtitle: by **Hannah Khalil** (London-based, Palestine/Ireland)
        text: "*Blood Fruit* tells the true story of Mary Manning, a young shop worker
          in 1980s Dublin who refused to handle South African grapefruits and
          convinced her co-workers to strike to protest the Apartheid regime.
          Affiliated artist Hannah Khalil (*Scenes From 71* Years*) weaves a
          moving story about the power of protest and the difference individuals
          can make against systems of oppression."

        subtitle: by **Ahmed Masoud** (London-based, Gaza, Palestine)
        text: Award-winning writer and director Ahmed Masoud brings to life surprisingly
          funny and boldly human stories about four young people in Palestine
          and Israel. Thirteen-year-old Thaer is on a boat in the waters between
          Turkey and Greece. He is troubled, but not because he might drown any
          minute. Nibal is finishing her SAT exams in an American style school
          in Ramallah while well-meaning suitors pester her father with marriage
          proposals. Gaza taxi driver Zeid uses Tinder obsessively to try to
          find a date. Sami dreams of becoming a famous actor, but as an Arab
          actor, is he willing to take on the roles he’s offered to get known by
          established Israeli directors?
