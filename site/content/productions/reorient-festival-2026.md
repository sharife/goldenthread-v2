          by **Hassan Abdulrazzak** (London-based, Iraq)


          A hard-hitting play by artistic affiliate Hassan Abdulrazzah (*Love, Apples, and Bombs*), *Dare Not Speak* focuses on a young child, murdered in a genocide, as she pitches her story to a theater artistic director who is reluctant to put it on stage.
        text: Ahmed is waiting in an immigration line as his thoughts race, skid, and
          trip him up as he anticipates the things that might be asked, the
          papers he’ll have to show, and the personal information he might have
          to share. It is not a pretty stream of consciousness.

          boyfriend Joel. But it's really not his fault Joel went snooping,
          finding Sam's FUCK FORM, with all the raunchy descriptions of his
          recent hookups. So here they are at ODYSSEY, San Francisco's hottest,
          new Couple Therapy practice. Will Sam and Joel manage to fix this hot
          mess with the assistance of their overwhelmed but well-meaning
          counselor, Sharon... or is this all doomed for failure?

          identity battle over controlling the narrative. When they start
          eliminating each other, it becomes unclear who is writing whom.

          behind-the-scenes (see link below, or read it at
          [lmda.org](https://lmda.org/reorient-2023-festival)). Be sure to check
