Her body is stimulated through exercise with two hormones, dopamine and adrenaline, alternating between destruction and construction. In Medea-like fashion, this cycle within Hajj Ali — woman, wife and mother — echoes that of her city, one that destroys to build and builds to destroy.

Acclaimed Lebanese writer and performer, Hajj Ali brings her one-woman show to the Bay Area following her celebrated performances at the Kennedy Center and the Guthrie Theater.

Performed in Arabic with English super titles. 

# Reviews

“Gloriously unpredictable and compelling.… a radical challenge to the stereotypes and prejudices that afflict global perceptions of Arab women.” Cat Acheson, *The Skinny*

“And yet to call Jogging a play about running would be like calling The Odyssey a story about sailing. As with Ali’s layers of scarves and hair, the deceptively straightforward premise unfolds itself into proliferating narratives, voices, and histories. It’s a play that meditates on what it is to be a woman, a wife, a mother, a citizen, and an artist.” Katie Logan, *Arablit*
