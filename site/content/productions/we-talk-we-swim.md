heading: Dive into the murky waters of family, identity, and politics
description: >-
  While trying to navigate the currents of the Pacific, an Arab-American woman and her nephew, who has enlisted in the military, dive into the murky waters of family, identity, and politics. Adventurous and playful, We Swim takes the form of a literal conversation on stage, and expands into a nuanced dialogue about what it means to be American, Arab, and Arab-American at our current moment in time. Lebanese-American writer Mona Mansour returns to Golden Thread for her fourth production — her most ambitious and personal to date.<br /><br />The play offers its audience an opportunity to examine America’s relationship with its military, as well as its growing Middle Eastern immigrant population. It blurs the lines between “us” and “them,” and presents a provocative exploration of the tragic and indelible ripples of war.

## Reviews

**HIGHEST RATING!** 
"A unifying cleanse... Mansour’s disarmingly naturalistic dialogue helps make these seismic structural shifts work. Over and over again, you might find yourself thinking, “Wow, this is how people actually talk” — not to stoke drama for some playwright’s convenience, but to hedge, to test boundaries, to pursue what they want, and then to placate, to retreat, to regret." —Lily Janiak, *San Francisco Chronicle* [**(read full review)**](https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/theater/a-unifying-cleanse-in-sfs-golden-threads-we-swim-we-talk-we-go-to-war)

"*We Swim* has an off-handed beauty... Its pleasures are engaging in ways that political theatre rarely is." —John Wilkins, *The Free Audience*

"A poetic visual approach... Feels refreshing from the get-go." —Jim Gladstone, *Bay Area Reporter*

"Imaginative... There’s humor and an engaging earnestness." —Jean Schiffman, *San Francisco Examiner*

"Excellently choreographed... Odcikin's direction is to be commended." —Carol Benet, *For All Events*

"Working on a bare-bones unit set designed by Kate Boyd and enhanced by Mona Kasra’s projections, Odcikin has done an impressive job of shaping the conversations." —George Heymont, *My Cultural Landscape*

"Compelling... Director Evren Odcikin handles changes of pace and place handily." —Sam Hurwitt, *Mercury News*
