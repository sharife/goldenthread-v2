description: >-
  A picnic interrupted by soldiers. Never-ending lines. Sunbathing in the shadow
  of a tank. Palestinian-Irish playwright Hannah Khalil draws from stories of
  family and friends to reveal the real human story: the dreams, comedy,
  sadness, and frustrations of daily life in the shadow of the ‘separation
  wall.’ The cast includes members of the Bay Area Palestinian community.

## Reviews

**★★★★★ &#8220;Exceptional&#8230; wickedly funny and heartbreaking**&#8221; —*The Stage*

**★★★★ &#8220;A deeply compassionate play**&#8230; a powerful yet tender collection of everyday vignettes&#8221;  —*Time Out*

&#8220;This new work confirms Hannah Khalil as **a dramatist of compelling potential**.&#8221; —*Telegraph*

&#8220;Smart and economical, simultaneously resonant with warmth and humanity, and shot through with exquisitely dark comedy. These scenes combine into a **deft, kaleidoscopic portrait of ongoing struggle, acceptance, and simple survival**.&#8221; —*Exeunt Magazine*
