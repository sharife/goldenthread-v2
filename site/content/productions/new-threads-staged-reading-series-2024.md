          An autobiographical monodrama written by Raeda Taha, a Palestinian
          actor, storyteller, writer, and political activist based on her
          personal experience as the daughter of a shaheed (martyr). The play is
          anchored by Raeda's memories, as well as those of her mother, Fathia,
          and her Aunt Suhaila, whose journey to retrieve the body of her
          brother—which was kept in a morgue freezer for two years by the
          occupying forces—is at the center of this story. Raeda crafts an epic
          narrative that delves into the complexities of loss, grief, and the
          enduring impact of political conflict. *Where can I find someone like
          you, Ali?* offers a deeply human portrayal of one of many Palestinian
          martyrs, Ali Taha, a father, a husband and a brother and is ultimately
          about the experience of many of those left behind by Palestinian
          martyrs.

          Two people meet in an auto-body shop in the mid-sized city Herzliya.
          They might or might not have known each other in the past. One of them
          is Palestinian, one of them is Israeli Jewish. By the end of the play,
          both of their lives will be changed forever by the realities that
          surround them.


          The authors have stated “*The Return* is not a documentary. There are no checkpoints or tanks onstage.  The play is a personal closeup of what happens underneath the headlines, every day for decade after decade, even when bombs are not falling to catch the world’s attention.”

        starting with hand painted denim to ceilings and four-wall murals. With
        a focus on Middle-Eastern inspired creation, her art brings a warm

        home."

New Threads is Golden Thread’s annual staged reading series that engages its audience in the process of playmaking and allows writers of Middle Eastern and non-Middle Eastern descent an authentic and supportive space to develop work about the Middle East. Since its launch in 2011, many New Threads plays and playwrights have continued on to receive mainstage productions.
