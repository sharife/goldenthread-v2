description: >-
  In the wake of the 1967 Six-Day War, with the borders finally open after two
  decades, Said and Safiyya, a Palestinian couple, return to Haifa in search of
  the echoes of a home they were forced to abandon during the Nakba in 1948. But
  are they truly ready for the encounter that awaits them upon their return?
  *Returning to Haifa* presents a deeply human portrait of two families, one
  Palestinian, and one Israeli Jewish, forced by history into an intimacy they
  didn’t choose. 


  “A moving confrontation between two sets of displaced people and an utterly unsentimental exploration of the complexities of home, history and parenthood.” - *Michael Billington, The Guardian, 5 March 2018* 


  "*Returning to Haifa* is a beautiful and important play portraying the personal tragedies created because of much bigger acts between humans." - *Nabila Said, Exeunt Magazine, 24 March 2018*

      bio: >-
        **Ghassan Kanafani** was one of the most prominent Arab novelists and
        modernist playwrights whose pen made him a target for the Israeli
        Mossad, who assassinated him at the age of thirty-six years old. Using
        the words of Palestinian actor and storyteller Raeda Taha, in her new
        play *The Gazelle of Aka* about the life and death of Ghassan Kanafani,
        she writes: “Ghassan was a journalist, political activist, and the
        spokesman for the PFLP (The Popular Front for the Liberation of
        Palestine). He used to paint, draw, sculpt, and constantly sketch. He
        loved drawing - and especially enjoyed gifting his drawings to his
        friends \[…] Ghassan wrote Life. He wrote about his love of songs,
        music, and literature. He wrote about his childhood memories as a
        refugee, he wrote about the refugee camps. He wrote about the Nakba and
        the collective expulsion. He wrote about his assassination.”


        His novella *Returning to Haifa*, one of the most important works in contemporary Palestinian literature, was first published in 1969 and was translated into various languages, including Japanese, English, Russian, and Persian.

        in film acting techniques and scene study under the teachings of Lon
        Baumgarner in a Stanislavski style approach, as well as on camera
        techniques and stage acting through the training of Kevin Patrick
        Murphy. Her love for acting stems from her fascination in human
        connection and a scene’s ability to enforce the confrontations of one’s
        own emotions and self. When she’s not in a class or doing scene work,
        you can find her on a nature walk, thrifting, or working on film
        photography."
