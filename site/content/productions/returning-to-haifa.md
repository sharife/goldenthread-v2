description: In the wake of the 1967 Six-Day War, with the borders finally open
  after two decades, Said and Safiyya, a Palestinian couple, return to Haifa in
  search of the echoes of a home they were forced to abandon during the Nakba in
  1948. But are they truly ready for the encounter that awaits them upon their
  return? *Returning to Haifa* presents a deeply human portrait of two families,
  one Palestinian, and one Jewish, forced by history into an intimacy they
  didn’t choose.
