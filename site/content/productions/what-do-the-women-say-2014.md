        to be making her Golden Thread debut in The Fifth String. After
        receiving her M.A. in Postcolonial Anthropology in San Francisco, Naima
        turned her focus toward music and song as vessels for story-telling,
        healing and movement building. Believing in the power of sharing
        messages from the soul through sound, Shalhoub immersed herself in her
        cultural roots in Lebanon and started writing her own music embracing
        both joy and sorrow, and the spaces between. In 2010 she began
        performing her music in the Bay Area, getting featured on radio stations
        and reputable venues, and began building fan bases internationally such
        as in Beirut and Kashmir. Naima recently released her first single and
        music video “herstory of soul,” and is currently teaching, performing,
        and working on her debut full-length album."

Everyone seems to have an opinion about Muslim women, even (especially!) those who have never met one, say co-editors Ayesha Mattu and Nura Maznavi of *Love, InshAllah: The Secret Love Lives of American Muslim Women,* “it’s about time we heard directly from Muslim women themselves.” Golden Thread’s artistic director, Torange Yeghiazarian couldn’t agree more. “No other territory is coveted and fought over as much as women’s bodies,” Yeghiazarian explains, “from the American Right-wing conservatives to the Taliban and Ayatollahs in Iran, the real battle is over controlling women’s bodies and sexual expression.” Join us for this year’s ***What do the Women Say?*** and find out how this group of Middle Eastern women artists counter and shatter stereotypes.

**Bareed Mista3jil** features 41 stories in Arabic and English, each one originating from interviews with some 150 lesbian/bi/trans/questioning women from various regions of Lebanon.  “The title of the book, Express Mail, really indicates the urgency of the stories and the private nature of them that needed to be told, made public,” explained Nadine Mouawad, a member of the Feminist Collective, involved from the project’s inception. Since 2009, Bareed Mista3jil has been presented in the San Francisco Bay Area, at the AWID Istanbul conference 2012, and at the Aat Festival of Women’s Theater in Amman, Jordan, 2013. The book was produced by Meem, a feminist organization in Beirut with a focus on community building through programming and counseling.
