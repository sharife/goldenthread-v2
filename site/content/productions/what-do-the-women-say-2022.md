Showcasing the work of multi-generational MENA women artists who are making home away from home, the program will feature a poetry reading by award-winning Lebanese poet [Zeina Hashem Beck](www.zeinahashembeck.com/), a dramatic reading by Palestinian actor and playwright [Hend Ayoub](https://www.hendayoub.com/) from her one woman show Home?, a performance by Yemeni song writer and Oud artist Layle Omeran, an excerpt from the documentary film by Iranian filmmaker [Sabereh Kashi](https://www.filmmakerscollaborative.org/home-yet-far-away) Home Yet Far Away, and a sneak peek into the rehearsal studio of Palestinian dancer [Leila Awadallah](https://www.leilaawadallah.com/new-index). Following the presentations, Executive Artistic Director Sahar Assaf will be joined by Afghan writer, speaker and consultant [Humaira Ghilzai](https://www.humairaghilzai.com/) to facilitate a conversation between the participating artists and the audience. 

Raeshma Razvi and Maddie Rostami from the [Shahrazad Squad](https://shahrazadsquad.org/) will be engaging in-person audiences in the lobby at Brava with story-bites inspired by the 1001 Nights starting at 7:00pm.

The full program is 100 minutes without intermission.
