        title: "Episode 2: MENA Playwrights on Storytelling"
        pre: June 7, 2023
        text: Join the playwrights of the 2023 ReOrient Festival as they discuss a
          number of topics related to their work making theatre in the U.S.
          today.
        subtitle: >-
          In this episode of No Summary, we are thrilled to bring together a
          panel of MENA playwrights who are writing powerful stories for U.S.
          audiences and using their platforms to shed light on the experiences
          of underrepresented communities. Join us as we delve into the creative
          process of playwriting, the challenges, and opportunities of bringing
          diverse stories to the stage, and the impact that these stories can
          have on audiences. Catherine Coray will moderate the panel of guests
          including playwrights Yussef El Guindi, Denmo Ibrahim, and Hadi
          Tabbal. The playwrights will share their experiences, discuss the
          significance of storytelling in MENA cultures and reflect on the ways
          in which their work has contributed to the broader discourse on race,
          power, and representation in the U.S. 


          The panel will be joined by a MENA American Theater class at California Polytechnic State University, designed by professor Hala Baki to imagine how MENA theater can contribute to a more inclusive American culture, and a Plays and Styles drama class at the University of Washington taught by Mona Merhi who focused the course on topics related to race, ethnicity, and identity representation by examining the works of playwrights from the MENA region alongside modern and contemporary western texts.
