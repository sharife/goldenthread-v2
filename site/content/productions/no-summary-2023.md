          In this episode of No Summary, we are thrilled to bring together a
          panel of MENA playwrights who are writing powerful stories for U.S.
          audiences and using their platforms to shed light on the experiences
          of underrepresented communities. Join us as we delve into the creative
          process of playwriting, the challenges, and opportunities of bringing
          diverse stories to the stage, and the impact that these stories can
          have on audiences. **[Catherine
          Coray](https://tisch.nyu.edu/about/directory/drama/94426744)** will
          moderate the panel of guests including playwrights **[Yussef El
          Guindi](https://goldenthread.org/about/people/#open-modal-Yussef%20El%20Guindi)**,
          **[Denmo
          Ibrahim](https://goldenthread.org/about/people/#open-modal-Denmo%20Ibrahim)**,
          and **Hadi Tabbal**. The playwrights will share their experiences,
          discuss the significance of storytelling in MENA cultures and reflect
          on the ways in which their work has contributed to the broader
          discourse on race, power, and representation in the U.S. 


          The panel will be joined by a MENA American Theater class at [California Polytechnic State University](https://catalog.calpoly.edu/collegesandprograms/collegeofliberalarts/theatredance/), designed by professor **[Hala Baki](https://theatredance.calpoly.edu/hala-baki-0)** to imagine how MENA theater can contribute to a more inclusive American culture, and a Plays and Styles drama class at the [University of Washington](https://drama.washington.edu/bachelor-arts-drama) taught by **[Mona Merhi](https://drama.washington.edu/people/mona-merhi)** who focused the course on topics related to race, ethnicity, and identity representation by examining the works of playwrights from the MENA region alongside modern and contemporary western texts.

          competency, the multiple forms of criticism, and the ways that SWANA
          artists and academics seek to change the game.
