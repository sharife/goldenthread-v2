  b﻿y **Adam Ashraf Elsayigh**\

  g﻿enerative dramaturgy by **Salma S. Zohdi**\

  d﻿irected by **Evren Odcikin**


  In 2011, blogger Alaa Abd El-Fattah became a leading voice of the Egyptian Revolution by fusing his activism and tech acumen, inadvertently following in his famous family’s activist legacy. Since then, he has spent much of the last decade in prison, unlawfully held by a military regime seeking to silence him and his family. Weaving writings and personal testimonials from Alaa and his family matriarchs, this epic and ambitious script-in-hand workshop presentation will present the second play in the Trilogy focusing on 2011 to 2014. 


  *ALAA: A Family Trilogy* is commissioned by **Golden Thread Productions** with support from the **Gerbode Foundation**. This presentation is part of the **Z Space Technical Residency Program**, supported by the **Mellon Foundation**.

      bio: Adam Ashraf Elsayigh was born in Cairo, Egypt. When soon thereafter, his
        parents relocated the family to Dubai, Adam grew up in a religious
        Muslim household with American cable TV, going to a British school in a
        Gulf state where over 90% of the population were migrant workers. This
        upbringing at the cross-section of cultures is at the core of the artist
        Adam is. Today, Adam is a writer, theatermaker, and dramaturg who writes
        and develops plays that interrogate the intersections of queerness,
        immigration, and colonialism. Adam’s plays (including *[Drowning in
        Cairo](https://goldenthread.org/productions/drowning-in-cairo/)*,
        *Revelation*, *Memorial*, and *Jamestown/ Williamsburg*) have been
        developed and seen at New York Theater Workshop, The Lark, The Tisch
        School of the Arts, The LaGuardia Performing Arts Center, and Golden
        Thread Productions. Adam is a fellow at Georgetown University's
        Laboratory for Global Performance and an Alliance/Kendeda Award
        Finalist. He holds a BA in Theater and Dramaturgy from NYU Abu Dhabi and
        an MFA in Playwriting from Brooklyn College. Learn more about what Adam

**Alaa Abd el-Fattah** is arguably the most high-profile political prisoner in Egypt, rising to international prominence during the revolution of 2011. A fiercely independent thinker who fuses politics and technology in powerful prose, Alaa’s voice came to symbolize much of what was fresh, inspiring and revolutionary about the uprisings that have defined the last decade. He has been in prison for almost 10 years. **[Follow #FreeAlaa movement to find out more.](https://goldenthread.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3d1bb4f6bf040470966bd4152&id=872a22d66c&e=a2b023867c)**
