In 2011, blogger Alaa Abd El-Fattah’s animated writing fused his activism and technological acumen, making him one of the Egyptian Revolution’s leading youth voices. But Alaa has spent much of the decade since unlawfully imprisoned by the counter-revolutionary military dictatorship. Juxtaposing physical storytelling with projections, ALAA: A Family Trilogy is a family saga that traces the lineage of Alaa's family through Abd El-Fattah’s recently published anthology of personal testimonials as well as interviews conducted with Alaa's family’s matriarchs. The historical epic dramatizes the Egyptian Revolution and the counterrevolution to follow, through the legacy of Egypt’s most high-profile political prisoner and the family he came from.
