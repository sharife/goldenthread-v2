Adapted from folks tales centered around the wise fool renowned in Central Asia, Turkey and Iran - Mulla Nasrudin or Nasrudin Hoja - *Nasrudin's Magnificent Journey to Samarkand* is a colorful and dynamic performance with dance and music. Nasrudin's clever wisdom and propensity for exposing hypocracy, frequently gets him into trouble.
