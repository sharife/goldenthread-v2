  Middle East. Join the creative process of making a new play, and discover
  brilliant gems never before seen in the Bay Area!


  Since its launch in 2011, many New Threads plays and playwrights have continued on to receive mainstage productions. The readings are accompanied by talkbacks with the artists and other experts that comment on the themes of the play.

          ***This special opening event is only available via digital
          live-stream.***


          On August 4, 2020, at 6:07 PM one of the biggest non-nuclear explosions in the history of mankind happened at the port of Beirut, Lebanon. This catastrophic event claimed the lives of more than 200 victims, injured 7000 and left 300,000 homeless and caused massive property damage across the city. Golden Thread Productions collaborates with **Al Madina Theatre** and the **Legal Agenda** in Lebanon to present *I Want to Tell You About Beirut*, which commemorates the 1-year mark of the explosion that ruined the lives of thousands of innocent civilians. The event will commence with a recorded reading of testimonies presented in English and Arabic by actors based in San Francisco and actors based in Beirut and will be followed by a live roundtable discussion featuring **Sahar Assaf** (Executive Artistic Director, Golden Thread Productions), **Nidal Alashkar** (Artistic Director, Al Madina Theatre), **Zeina Daccache** (Executive Director, Catharsis - Lebanese Center for Drama Therapy), **Ghida Frangieh** (Lawyer, Legal Agenda), **Tania El Khoury** (Director, OSUN Center for Human Rights and the Arts at Bard), and **Hamed Sinno** (Musician and Writer). 


          The event is accessible for English and Arabic speaking audiences and will last for approximately 90 minutes.


          Space is limited. Register early for Zoom participation. 


          This program will also be broadcast on [Howlround](https://howlround.com/happenings/livestreaming-performance-and-conversation-i-want-tell-you-about-beirut).

          A couple on an uncomfortable mini-break; a pair of mothers with a
          child who won’t wake up; and two post-COVID 19, post-Capitol riots
          encounters; form this new play cycle by three acclaimed Arab writers.
          In Golden Thread’s unique commission, three of the company’s Resident
          Artists, **Hassan Abdulrazzak**, **Hannah Khalil**, and **Mona
          Mansour**, reflect on the world now. 


          Despite being in different countries (Hassan and Hannah in the UK and Mona in the US) the trio worked closely, connecting online and taking each other’s ideas as inspiration. They spent time talking about what felt important and resonant after this time of change.  The result is a series of satirical, moving and poignant vignettes that will give audiences much food for thought. 


          The in-person event has been cancelled due to health and safety.

          Maro Thompson, a widowed music teacher resolved to admitting her
          rapidly deteriorating mother, Zada, into a nursing home, hires Emilio,
          an impassioned artist in need of a day gig to help clean out the
          family house. Unbeknownst to Maro, the willful Zada has other plans
          that evening and invites the family over to celebrate her 84th
          birthday. The party gets turned on its head when Emilio discovers a
          cache of abstract paintings hidden away in an upstairs closet. As the
          mystery behind the decades-old artwork unravels, Maro learns of her
          connection to Armenia’s painfully dark history.


          The in-person event has been cancelled due to health and safety.
