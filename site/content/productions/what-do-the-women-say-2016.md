        produced dozens of original works, as well as expanding traditional
        Central Asian dance forms for contemporary theater presentations. Her

        Persian/Afghan/Central Asian dance and its preservation in the diaspora
        at a critical time in history. Describing herself as a “perpetual
        student of art and life” and an “Executive Director by default”, Sawyer
        has garnered the support of many prestigious grants and awards for the

        establish an ongoing performing arts exchange in Tajikistan. Productions
        in the Bay Area include world dance/music events and concerts such as
        the Festival of the Silk Road, and the NeekOn Festival in Golden Gate
