    - bio: A prolific dance artist, choreographer/director/arts activist **Sharlyn
        Sawyer**’s career in the performing arts spans more than 45 years. As
        the Artistic and Executive Director of Afsaneh Art & Culture Society –
        Ballet Afsaneh, a company she founded in 1986, she has choreographed and
        produced dozens of original works, as well as expanding traditional
        Central Asian dance forms for contemporary theater presentations. Her
        company has had a major impact on the development of
        Persian/Afghan/Central Asian dance and its preservation in the diaspora
        at a critical time in history. Describing herself as a “perpetual
        student of art and life” and an “Executive Director by default”, Sawyer
        has garnered the support of many prestigious grants and awards for the
        Afsaneh Art & Culture Society – Ballet Afsaneh. Working internationally,
        Sawyer created performances for the British Museum, and was sought out
        by the San Francisco philanthropic foundation, The Christensen Fund, to
        establish an ongoing performing arts exchange in Tajikistan. Productions
        in the Bay Area include world dance/music events and concerts such as
        the Festival of the Silk Road, and the NeekOn Festival in Golden Gate
        Park.
