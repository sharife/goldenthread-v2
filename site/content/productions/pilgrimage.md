   A co-production with **Z Space**

  Five women embark on a pilgrimage to Mecca. Noor, an Afghan American immigrant, must fulfill her sister’s last wish. Her daughter, Maryam, a tech CEO, seeks to evade her legal woes, while Noor’s nieces—estranged sisters Sosan and Nadia—must complete the pilgrimage to claim their inheritance. Meanwhile, Fatima, a Black Muslim convert and Nadia’s best friend, hopes to find her biological mother. Will this pilgrimage bring the five women closer, or will secrets, rivalries, and old wounds tear them apart?

"﻿In 2015, I made a pilgrimage to Mecca with my aunt Mayen and a group of lively Afghan-American women. I was one of the youngest in the group, which meant I enjoyed the attention of all the aunties I picked up along the way. The journey was both a bonding experience with elders in my community and an awakening to the generational trauma woven through our lives. That experience became the seed from which *Pilgrimage* took root." [﻿(Read about Humaira's personal inspiration behind *Pilgrimage*!)](https://goldenthread.org/posts/from-pilgrimage-playwright-humaira-ghilzai/)

*P﻿ilgrimage* was developed as part of New Threads Staged Reading Series in 2022.
