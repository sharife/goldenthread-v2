  b﻿y **Humaira Ghilzai** and **Bridgette Dutta Portman**

   A co-production with **Z Space**

  Five women embark on a pilgrimage to Mecca. Noor, an Afghan American immigrant, must fulfill her sister’s last wish. Her daughter, Maryam, a tech CEO, seeks to evade her legal woes, while Noor’s nieces—estranged sisters Sosan and Nadia—must complete the pilgrimage to claim their inheritance. Meanwhile, Fatima, a Black Muslim convert and Nadia’s best friend, hopes to find her biological mother. Will this pilgrimage bring the five women closer, or will secrets, rivalries, and old wounds tear them apart?

      bio: >-
        **Z Space** empowers artistic risk, collaboration, and camaraderie
        amongst artists, audience, and community in the service of creating,
        developing, and presenting new work. Operating out of an old can factory
        in the Mission District of San Francisco, Z Space now activates two
        venues, an 85-seat intimate theater and a 236-seat flexible performance
        space, with a warehouse aesthetic and an adventurous edge. Eschewing
        traditional theater models with fixed seasons and a singular artistic
        vision, Z Space strives to embrace a multitude of artistic voices
        through a variety of programs and partnerships. 


        Keystone initiatives include New Work, a development, production, and presentation program that supports artists and ensembles from conception to realization of unique works; [Word for Word](https://www.zspace.org/aboutwordforword), a resident performing arts company that transforms works of literature verbatim to the stage; [Youth Arts](https://www.zspace.org/yaoverview), an arts education program promoting literacy and creativity; the [Curated Rental Program](https://www.zspace.org/rent), which opens our venues for use by a variety of artists and arts groups; and the [Residency Program](https://www.zspace.org/residencies) which provide an artistic home for artists and organizations in search of growth and community as they develop their artistic voice. Annually, we reach approximately 22,000 audience members, 800 youth and children through Youth Arts, and approximately 50 small and mid-size arts organizations.
