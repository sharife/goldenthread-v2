        text: Just in time for LGBTQIA+ Pride Month, a few of our community artivists
          will be having a kiki to discuss deviant theatrics. They'll be talking
          about working as SWANA Queers in various American theater scenes, and
          sharing what it takes to keep their artivists' bodies and minds in
          tune. It's all about juggling the entertainment industry of the
          Western and Eastern Hemispheres, with an LGBTQ+ spin!

          playwright of *The Language of Wild Berries,* which will be released
          as a radio play on October 6th. One of Iran’s leading playwrights,
          Samini’s work has been presented across Europe and Asia but she has
          never been produced in the US in English. At a time when US-Iran
          relations are at an all-time low, hearing directly from artists that
          create in both countries has never been more vital. The cast and
          creative team from the radio play will join the conversation."

          Hamami**, **Hannah Khalil**, and **Mona Mansour**. We recently

          collaboration model to co-write a new play, and Hamami will write a
          play exploring the Black Panthers’ residency in Algeria in the 1960s
          and 70s.
