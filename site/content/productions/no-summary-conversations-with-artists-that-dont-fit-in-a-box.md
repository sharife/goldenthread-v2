          theatre companies in the United States: Dunya Productions in Seattle,
          Peydah Theatre Company in New York City, and Medina Theater Collective
          in Chicago, whose work is bravely making space for diverse SWANA
          stories in the U.S. theatre scene. **Andrea Assaf** (writer,
          performer, director and the founding Artistic/Executive Director of
          Art2Action, Inc.) will facilitate this conversation with **Nabra
          Nelson** (theatre creator and founding company member of Dunya
          Productions), **Shadi Ghaheri** (director, choreographer, writer and
          founding member of Peydah Theatre Company), and **Rohina Malik**
          (playwright and solo performer and Founding Artistic Director of
          Medina Theater collective) as they tell us about their companies’
          missions and visions, the projects they’re working on and what it
          means to be amplifying the voices of marginalized communities in
          today’s USA."

          playwright of *The Language of Wild Berries,* which will be released
          as a radio play on October 6th. One of Iran’s leading playwrights,
          Samini’s work has been presented across Europe and Asia but she has
          never been produced in the US in English. At a time when US-Iran
          relations are at an all-time low, hearing directly from artists that
          create in both countries has never been more vital. The cast and
          creative team from the radio play will join the conversation."

          Hamami**, **Hannah Khalil**, and **Mona Mansour**. We recently

          collaboration model to co-write a new play, and Hamami will write a
          play exploring the Black Panthers’ residency in Algeria in the 1960s
          and 70s.

          change leadership? How does it feel to step in the shoes of a
          trailblazer? And what is the new leader’s vision for the
          organization’s future? Tune in to find out! Author, director, theatre
          professor at University of Oregon, and leading specialist on Middle

          will be having a kiki to discuss deviant theatrics. They'll be talking

          sharing what it takes to keep their artivists' bodies and minds in
          tune. It's all about juggling the entertainment industry of the
