  We're delighted to bring you the World Premiere of Adam Ashraf Elsayigh’s
  *Drowning in Cairo,* originally presented and partially developed as part of
  Golden Thread's New Threads Reading Series in 2018.


  It is May 2001 in Cairo. Moody, Khalid, and their servant Taha are on the Queen Boat, a gay nightclub docked on the Nile. When an unexpected police raid results in the arrest and public humiliation of the attendees, the lives of these young men are altered forever. **Adam Ashraf Elsayigh’s** debut production weaves budding romances, class differences, and familial expectations into a loving portrait of three men who all struggle to rebuild their lives against all odds.


  Adam says: "Golden Thread was my first artistic home in the U.S.; my experience workshopping an early draft of Drowning in Cairo at Golden Thread showed me that there was a space for my voice and artistry in this country. That the same play gets to have its world premiere here, four years later, especially under the brilliant direction and artistry of Sahar Assaf, feels like a true blessing and homecoming."


  Check out this episode of our digital series NO SUMMARY: Conversations with Artists Who Don’t Fit in a Box, which featured Adam in conversation with Drowning in Cairo director and Golden Thread Executive Artistic Director Sahar Assaf on December 3, 2021, to learn more.

      bio: Adam Ashraf Elsayigh (he/him) is an Egyptian playwright, dramaturg, and
        theater maker living in New York. Through his writing and producing,
        Adam interrogates the intersections of queerness, immigration, and
        colonialism. Some of Adam's plays include Memorial,
        Jamestown/Williamsburg, The Marginalia, and Drowning in Cairo. Adam is a
        fellow at Georgetown University's Laboratory for Global Performance and
        a Co-Founder and former Co-Producer of The Criminal Queerness Festival.
        Adam's work has been seen at IRT Theater, Dixon Place, Golden Thread
        Productions, and The NYU Abu Dhabi Arts Center. When he’s not
        frantically drafting a new play or producing a theater festival, you can
        probably find Adam running on the GWB, volunteering, or planning his
        next charcuterie brunch. Adam holds a BA in Theater with an emphasis in
        Playwriting and Dramaturgy from NYU Abu Dhabi and is currently pursuing
        his MFA in Playwriting at Brooklyn College.
