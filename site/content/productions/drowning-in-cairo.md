description: '"When I first read Drowning in Cairo by Adam Ashraf Elsayigh,
  which was partially developed at New Threads in 2018, it felt like the perfect
  play for my directorial debut at Golden Thread. Despite the heart-wrenching
  sorrow it reflects through the story of the three young men, I read it as a
  story that celebrates love and life, and celebrating love and life in their
  diversity is what we utterly need after the painful two years." - Sahar Assaf'

      bio: Adam Ashraf Elsayigh (he/him) is an Egyptian playwright, dramaturg, and
        theater maker living in New York. Through his writing and producing,
        Adam interrogates the intersections of queerness, immigration, and
        colonialism. Some of Adam's plays include Memorial,
        Jamestown/Williamsburg, The Marginalia, and Drowning in Cairo. Adam is a
        fellow at Georgetown University's Laboratory for Global Performance and
        a Co-Founder and former Co-Producer of The Criminal Queerness Festival.
        Adam's work has been seen at IRT Theater, Dixon Place, Golden Thread
        Productions, and The NYU Abu Dhabi Arts Center. When he’s not
        frantically drafting a new play or producing a theater festival, you can
        probably find Adam running on the GWB, volunteering, or planning his
        next charcuterie brunch. Adam holds a BA in Theater with an emphasis in
        Playwriting and Dramaturgy from NYU Abu Dhabi and is currently pursuing
        his MFA in Playwriting at Brooklyn College.
