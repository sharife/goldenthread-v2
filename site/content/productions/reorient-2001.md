description: "Presented in three series, this year's ReOrient Festival opens
  less than a month after the horrific events of 9/11. In deciding to move
  forward, the company issued this statement: Since its inception, Golden Thread
  Productions has been dedicated to exploring the Middle Eastern culture and
  identity in all its complexity. Therefore, we feel as a company that now more
  than ever it is crucial to go forward with a cultural event that we hope will
  foster a deeper understanding of our shared humanity and shatter the commonly
  held stereotypes associated with the Middle East. We hope this open exchange
  will contribute to ending the vicious cycle of retaliation and intolerance."

          A nurse providing shelter to a patient during the Iran-Iraq war. *Was
          it adultery?*


          **Ghazi Rabihavi** (Playwright)- Since migrating to the U.K. from Iran where most of his writing is banned from publication, Ghazi has had a number of novels, short stories and plays published and produced in Europe. In 1997, Harold Pinter introduced Ghazi to the British public by producing his play *Look Europe!* at Almeida Theatre in London. Pinter called *Look Europe!* “A work of a gifted writer” and later described *Stoning* as “A very strong and powerful piece of work, beautifully constructed.” In addition to productions in London and Amsterdam *Look Europe!* has also been staged in New York at the Actors’ Studio. This is the world premier of *Stoning*. Ghazi is currently working on his new play, *Captured by Camera*, which will be performed in October in London and Amsterdam. It is based on a true story of Ahmad Batebi, an Iranian film student who is serving 15 years in prison for being photographed by a journalist during the recent student demonstrations in Tehran. *Captured by Camera* and *Look* *Europe!* are both written in support of the prisoners of conscious in Iran.

          Chekhov's classic comedy naturally lends itself to an Arab-American
          setting. The hapless suitor gets much more than he bargained for in
          the woman he perceives to be the perfect Arab wife.


          **Yussef El-Guindi** (Playwright: A Marriage Proposal & 3 Stops) - Primarily a playwright, Yussef  has been active as a poet, actor and filmmaker: His adaptation of Chekhov's *A Marriage Proposal* staged by the Arab Theatrical Arts Guild in Dearborn, MI was nominated for several PAGE awards including Outstanding Achievement in Original Play or Adaptation. His last poem, *Crossing Borders*, was published on placards and placed on buses as part of Seattle’s Poetry and Art on Buses. Yussef’s short film *Love Stalks* won an award for best short narrative film at Seattle Underground Film Festival and was aired on KTEH. A native of Egypt, Yussef holds an M.F.A in Playwriting from Carnegie-Mellon University and was playwright in-residence at Duke University.

          Harold Pinter who produced Rabihavi’s debut in London’s Almieda
          Theatre described *Stoning* as “A very strong and powerful piece of
          work, beautifully constructed.” Set during the Iran-Iraq war,
          *Stoning* presents the story of a woman accused of adultery. Through a
          series of 20 vignettes, Rabihavi masterfully reveals the inner
          workings of human emotions caught in an authoritarian regime where
          even one’s own flesh and blood cannot be trusted. Directed by Hal Gelb
          whose direction last June of Karim Alrawi’s *Deep Cut* was described
          as ‘Brilliant’ and ‘Flawless.’

Featuring new plays by Iranian playwright Ghazi Rabihavi, Egyptian playwright Yussef El Guindi, and Golden Thread's founder, Torange Yeghiazarian. Harold Pinter who produced Rabihavi’s debut in London’s Almeida Theatre described *Stoning* as “A very strong and powerful piece of work, beautifully constructed.” Set during the Iran-Iraq war, Stoning presents the story of a woman accused of adultery. Through a series of 20 vignettes, Rabihavi masterfully reveals the inner workings of human emotions caught in an authoritarian regime where even one’s own flesh and blood cannot be trusted. Presented in the same evening, two plays by El Guindi exemplify the rich palette of contemporary Middle Eastern playwrights bridging the ethnically specific with the universal: Chekhov’s masterful comedy, *A Marriage Proposal* set in an Arab-American immigrant family, and three strangers riding the bus on New Year's eve in *Three Stops*. ReOrient 2001 is pleased to introduce Myles Weber with Expatriates, A quirky snapshot of the life of expatriates in an unnamed desert city where one’s sexual orientation is a more closely guarded secret than the air raid schedule. Weber’s own experience as a Foreign Service officer in Riyadh lend Expatriates greater depth and realism.
