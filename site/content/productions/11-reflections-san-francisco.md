## An Ensemble Creation Process

***11Reflections: San Francisco*** w﻿as built by an amazing ensemble of artists of Southwest/Central Asian and North African (SWANA), Middle Eastern/North African/South Asian (MENASA), and Muslim American artists, BIPOC artists and allies, and impacted communities in the Bay Area. In May, 2024, these artists and community members gathered in Story Circles to take part in workshops and creative writing exercises in response to this question: What has the impact of the post-9/11 era been in your city, and how does it connect to what’s happening today? 

T﻿hese Story Circles were hosted by our partners, Aviva Arts and Red Poppy Art House.
