  This visually colorful performance with dynamic story-telling, dance and music
  is adapted from several folk tales centered around the comedic personage,
  Mulla Nasrudin or Nasrudin Hoja, a wise fool renowned in Central Asia, Turkey
  and Iran. We follow Nasrudinâ€™s adventures as he travels through caravansaries
  in Konya, Damascus and Isfahan before he arrives at his destination on the
  ancient Silk Route.


  Will Nasrudin and his faithful donkey ever make it to Samarkand, the center of arts and crafts on the ancient Silk Road? There is only one way to find out!
