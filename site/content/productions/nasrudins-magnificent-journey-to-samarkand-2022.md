This visually colorful performance featuring dynamic story-telling, dance, and music, is adapted from folktales centered around the comedic personage, Nasrudin Hoja, a wise fool renowned in Central Asia, Turkey, and Iran. The performance follows Nasrudin and his faithful donkey as they travel through caravansaries in Konya, Damascus, and Isfahan where Nasrudin’s clever wisdom and propensity for exposing hypocrisy frequently get him into trouble.
