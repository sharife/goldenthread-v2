        text: Kaan has been commissioned to make an adaptation of 1001 Nights from a
          Very Important Theater Company, and asked to bring his immigrant,
          Muslim, queer perspective to it. Unfortunately, he is not sure what
          all that means. As his characters revolt and refuse to tell the
          stories that he requires of them, can Kaan face his demons, change the
          minds and hearts of his audience, and save all the women of the
          kingdom in the process? Oriental is an absurdist look at the hilarious
          knots SWANA creatives must tie themselves in to tell their stories and
          make a career in the American theatre.

New Threads is Golden Threadâ€™s annual staged reading series that engages its audience in the process of playmaking and allows writers of Middle Eastern and non-Middle Eastern descent an authentic and supportive space to develop work about the Middle East. Since its launch in 2011, many New Threads plays and playwrights have continued on to receive mainstage productions.
