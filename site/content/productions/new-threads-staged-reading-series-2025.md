        text: Kaan has been commissioned to make an adaptation of *A Thousand and One
          Nights* from a Very Important Theater Company, and asked to bring his
          immigrant, Muslim, queer perspective to it. Unfortunately, he is not
          sure what all that means. As his characters revolt and refuse to tell
          the stories that he requires of them, can Kaan face his demons, change
          the minds and hearts of his audience, and save all the women of the
          kingdom in the process? *ORIENTAL* is an absurdist look at the
          hilarious knots SWANA creatives must tie themselves in to tell their
          stories and make a career in the American theatre.
