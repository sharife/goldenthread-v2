      bio: is an award-winning playwright and director passionate about building
        community through theater. Her artistic practice reflects her values of
        radical hospitality and inclusiveness aimed at disrupting stereotypes of
        the Middle East both within the community and outside of it. A
        transplant from the 1979 Iranian revolution, Torange believes that life
        is inherently political and that the personal and the global are
        inseparable. Her plays frequently explore the cultural divide with
        tenderness and humor from an immigrant woman’s perspective. As a
        director, Torange’s focus has been on new plays, experimenting with
        Middle Eastern performance traditions, and staging poetry. Dubbed the
        “Margo Jones–founding-mother-figure of Middle Eastern–American theatre”,
        Torange founded Golden Thread Productions, the first American theatre
        company devoted to the Middle East, and served as its Executive Artistic
        Director for twenty-five years. There she created visionary programs
        such as ReOrient Festival of Short Plays, premiered hundreds of plays,
        and launched the careers of countless artists. A recipient of the
        Gerbode Playwright Commission Award, Torange’s plays are published in
        New Iranian Plays, [Performing Iran,](<>) and Salaam.Peace Anthology of
        Middle Eastern American Drama. Torange was honored with a Lifetime
        Achievement Award by the Cairo International Festival.

# Oriental, or 1001 Ways to Tie Yourself in Knots

b﻿y **Evren Odcikin**\
d﻿irected by **Elizabeth Carter**\
dramaturgy by **Torange Yeghiazarian**

C﻿engiz has been commissioned to make an adaptation of *A Thousand and One Nights* from a Very Important Theater Company, and asked to bring his immigrant, Muslim, queer perspective to it. Unfortunately, he is not sure what all that means. As his characters revolt and refuse to tell the stories that he requires of them, can C﻿engiz face his demons, change the minds and hearts of his audience, and save all the women of the kingdom in the process? *ORIENTAL* is an absurdist look at the hilarious knots SWANA creatives must tie themselves in to tell their stories and make a career in the American theatre.
