***Lubbock or Leave It!*** is the story of Iranian New Yorker Leyla when she accepts a job teaching college in the most conservative town in the US: Lubbock, Texas! Set against a backdrop of American fundamentalism, Leyla and her canine cohort Daisy (played by a hand puppet) learn some hard lessons about xenophobia, nationalism, and dislocation.

***Zafira the Olive Oil Warrior*** tells the futuristic story of a homeless Arab American schoolteacher turned superhero.  She relives her experiences in an internment camp for Arabs and Muslims as she imagines herself victorious and powerful despite an increasingly hostile and ultra-nationalistic environment that has cast Arabs as enemies of the state.

Edited by Beau Beausoleil and Deema Shehabi, ***Al-Mutanabbi Street Starts Here*** is a collection of poetry and essays in response to the bombing of Al-Mutanabbi Street in Baghdad. It features Badr Shakir al-Sayyab, Iraq’s preeminent modern poet, in addition to Mahmoud Darwish, Majid Naficy, Naomi Shihab Nye, and Natalie Handal. Local poets Julie Bruck, Dima Hilal, Elmaz Abinader and Deema Shehabi are also featured among others.

Each year **Golden Thread Productions** celebrates International Women’s Day by showcasing the work of Middle Eastern women artists. Last year’s program featured Denmo Ibrahim, Jennifer Jajeh, Maryam Rostami and Rohiha Malek. Bay Area poets Deema Shehabi, Dina Omar, Lana Nasser, Esther Kamkar, Haleh Hatami and Elmaz Abinader have also performed at *What do the Women Say?* Past performances include works by Shahrnush Parsipur, Nawal el Saadawi, Rosemary Toohey, and Majeda Al Saqqa.
