  The first event in our 25th Anniversary Season is our first digital rendition
  of ***What Do the Women Say? Celebrating 25 Years of Centering Women
  Artists!*** Golden Thread began producing a Women’s Day event in 1999 titled,
  From the Inside. The event was a multi-media performance involving eight women
  artists including performers and visual artists.


  This year, we are speaking about Golden Thread’s legacy and impact with artists whose experience with Golden Thread ranges from one year to more than twenty years. What has Golden Thread’s impact been on these artists’ career? What is their hope for Golden Thread’s next 25 years?

          personal experience and larger social and political structures.
