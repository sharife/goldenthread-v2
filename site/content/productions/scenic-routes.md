description: Lana's family is intrigued by her new man, Naguib. Her mother wants
  to make sure he is "trustworthy" and her brother is hoping for Lawrence of
  Arabia. Lana and Naguib get ahead of the stereotypes when they joke about
  planting a bomb in a caf√© only to find themselves caught in a web of deception
  and mistrust when their alleged plan is actually played out.

Written in 1992, ***Scenic Routes*** explores the craggy terrain of cultural misunderstandings and misperceptions between an American woman, Lana, and an Egyptian man, Naguib. Beginning almost whimsically at a pick-up in a bar, the relationship soon gets mired in well intentioned but often clumsy attempts to bridge what are perceived as cultural divides. The initial and natural awkwardness of any two intimates getting to know each other soon gets blown up and erroneously labeled as cultural differences between two foreigners.

The Immigrant Theatre Project presented a staged reading of *Scenic* *Routes* in 2000 as part of the American Dreams: Plays About NY & the Immigrant Experience at the Tenement Theatre. Celia Braxton directed.
