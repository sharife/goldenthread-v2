      - subtitle: By Sadegh Hedayat, one of Iran's most respected writers and social

          A cartoonish parody of the Adam & Eve tale or did somebody say
          *Iranian Angles in America?* Not!


          Born to an aristocratic family in 1903 in Iran, **Sadegh Hedayat** was among those distinguished students sent to Europe by Reza Shah to earn an education with the expectation that they would facilitate the nation's progress towards modernization. Soon after his return Hedayat co-instituted the Rab'a (The Foursome) a group consisting of young returnees whose progressive ideas antagonized both the literati and the government. In 1936 the Rab'a was outlawed and Hedayat left for India. Hedayat's popularity outside Iran is due mostly to his short novel *The Blind Owl* (1937) which has been translated into numerous languages. Among his other published works are *Buried* *Alive* (1930), *Three Drops of Blood* (1932) and *Haji Aqa* (1945). In the majority of his works Hedayat is extremely critical of religion in general and the Moslem clergy in particular. He also looks down at the foreign powers involvement in Iran as well as the corruption that is rampant among the local government rank and file. The English text of *Myth of Creation* is translated by M.R. Ghanoonparvar and is based on the only version of the original Persian available (Paris 1946). This limited edition of 105 copies indicates that it was not for sale. Hedayat committed suicide in 1951, in Paris. (*The Pearl Cannon* \[Iraj Bashiri] and *The Myth of Creation* \[M.R. Ghanoonparvar] Mazda Publishers)

        title: The Muse

          described him as a "gifted writer.*"* Directed by Hal Gelb.

          An answering machine awaits. In this laconic study of loneliness, the
          color of exile is rendered *red.*


          Since migrating to United Kingdom from his native Iran in 1994 where he was banned from publication **Ghazi Rabihavi** has written several plays as well as short stories and novels. Among his published works are *The Iranian Four Seasons*, *Merriam's Smile*, *David* and *White Stone*. Harold Pinter introduced Ghazi to the British public by producing his play *Look Europe!* In 1997 which he called "A work of a gifted writer." A great source of inspiration and support, Pinter later wrote about the play *Stoning. "*A very strong and powerful piece of work, beautifully constructed." Ghazi is currently directing and producing four of his short plays with the support of the Queensland Multi-Media Art Center in London slated to open in late June of this year.

        title: Dear Mama, Love Emily
        text: This is the story of Emily Shihadeh, a Palestinian woman who at the age of
          seventeen immigrates to the United States of America to join her
          husband in San Francisco. 'A friend, told me as I shared with him my
          life in America, "You came to a country populated by your mother." How
          true that statement was! So many were so busy, they ignored me and
          were unable to express any feelings of warmth to me. That was just
          like my mother! I wanted to tell the people of this country about my
          people and their beauty and struggle. The devastation that happened in
          Palestine is known to very few. Through my personal stories I open a
          glimpse into life in Palestine.' Through a series of short letters
          addressed to her mother, the audience will share some of the
          challenges Emily faced coming to a new country trying to understand
          the people and their rules.
        subtitle: By Emily Shihadeh, who was born in Jerusalem and has lived in the Bay
          Area for the past forty-two years. Shihadeh has been presenting her
          one woman show "Grapes & Figs are in Season, A Palestinian Woman's
          Story" for ten years now all over the San Francisco Bay Area, the
          United States and in Tel Aviv, Haifa and
          Jerusalem. [www.emilyshi.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20160807100056/http://www.emilyshi.com/)
