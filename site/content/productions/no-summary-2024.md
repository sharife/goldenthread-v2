      bio: >-
        **Emile Saba,** born in September 1989, is a Palestinian director and
        actor, and currently assumes the role of Artistic Director at ASHTAR
        Theatre. Originally from Jaffa but was born and lives in the city of
        Ramallah, Saba's artistic journey reflects a passion for exploring the
        realms of magical realism and pushing the boundaries of the
        audience-performer relationship.

        Saba's academic and theatre foundation was laid at ASHTAR Theatre and later was developed at the University of Connecticut, where he earned his Master of Fine Arts in stage performance. The core of Saba's artistic identity lies in his curiosity to understand the human behavior and thinking.

        Among his notable acting productions is "2077, Who Wants to Survive," a compelling piece created by the director Simon Eifeler at Bridgeworks Theatre. His contributions to ASHTAR Theatre include noteworthy productions like "Free Play" and "Love on the Shelf," where he continues to push the boundaries of immersive theatre.

        Saba's artistic canvas taps into different genres and styles; such as "Taming of the Shrew" at Al Kasaba Theatre, and “Monodrama Jabra" at Inad Theatre. His collaboration with the Amwaj Choir Group in "Opera Amal" and "People by the Sea" at The Palestinian Museum and the circus show “Asimo” showcase his commitment to diversifying his artistic portfolio. Saba is currently preparing to start rehearsals on his new production “Guernica- Gaza”, a new collaboration between ASHTAR Theatre and two prominent playwrights, Naomi Wallace and Ismail Khalidi. The production will open in July 2024 and will participate at “Uncaging Our World” festival in Oxford.
