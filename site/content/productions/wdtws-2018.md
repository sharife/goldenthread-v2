    - bio: <strong>Atosa Melody Babaoff </strong>is a Resident Artist with Golden
        Thread Productions. She was just graduating from the American
        Conservatory Theater&#8217;s M.F.A. Program when she dove into her first
        Golden Thread production of <em>Nine Armenians</em> back in the
        early-2000s. She has worked with Golden Thread sporadically ever since,
        and this last experience with the ReOrient 2017 Festival left her
        feeling joyful and nourished as ever. She has also worked at A.C.T,
        Berkeley Rep, Magic Theatre, Marin Theatre Company, and was a company
        member of both Laura Arrington Dance and Liz Tenuto Dance and a Half,
        which led her to NYC twice for some amazing performances. She is a
        founding member of Affinity Project with Nora el Samahy, Beatrice Basso,
        and Emily Hoffman. They were recipients of grants/residencies that led
        them to perform with FoolsFURY and at YBCA. She has an abundant and
        lovely yoga career when not performing. She is grateful for all of the
        loved ones in her life who encourage her to keep pursuing all that she
        is passionate about, in art and in life.

    - bio: With a focus on gender, bicultural identity, and family, <strong>Yasmine
        Diaz</strong> works with mixed media on paper, drawing, and collage to
        question and assert her unique experiences as a Yemeni-American artist
        and feminist. Born in Chicago to parents who immigrated from the
        highlands of Yafa in Yemen, the Los Angeles-based artist uses compelling
        found imagery to juxtapose the opposing cultures she was raised within.
        Her work has been featured in Deeyah Khan&#8217;s<em> sister-hood
        Magazine</em>, <em>Kolaj Magazine</em>, the Albuquerque Museum of Art,
        and in the collections of the UCLA School of Public Affairs. Diaz is a
        past fellow and current co-organizer of the <em>at land’s edge</em>
        fellowship program. <strong><a

        women in Beirut working on a production of Sophocles&#8217;s
        <em>Antigone</em> directed by Bridgette Auger. A multi-lingual Tunisian

        sensitivity to her editing, production and story development, while
        building transmedia narratives to enhance and further engage a

    - bio: <strong>Naima Shalhoub</strong> is a Lebanese-American artist who uses
        music as a tool for transformation, liberation, education, and
        self-expression. Her dimensional work as a vocalist, composer,
        performing artist, and educator focuses on the expansive quality of the
        voice and its power for redemption and social justice. After receiving
        her M.A. in Postcolonial and Cultural Anthropology in 2008, she turned
        her focus to creation and performance in the Bay Area. In 2015, she
        recorded her debut album, <em>Live in San Francisco County Jail</em>,
        after a year of weekly “Music and Freedom” sessions with incarcerated
        women. In 2017, Naima toured Beirut, Lebanon, with a project titled
        NAMENA, building partnerships with local organizations and co-producing
        events that provide a platform to share creative responses to various
        forms of struggle. Naima released her EP titled <em>Borderlands</em> in
        Lebanon with a series of videos forthcoming about the project and music.
