  A Palestinian actor learns there’s more to English girls than pure sex appeal. A Pakistani-born terror suspect figures out what’s wrong with his first novel. A British youth suspects all is not what it seems with his object of desire. A New Yorker asks his girlfriend for a sexual favor at the worst possible time. *Love, Bombs & Apples* is the comic tale of four men, each from different parts of the globe, all experiencing a moment of revelation.
