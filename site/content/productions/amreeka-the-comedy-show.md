  Featuring Headliner  **Eman El-Husseini** with **Usama Siddiquee** 


  and **Charles McBee** as Master of Ceremonies


  Curated by our 2023 Artist-in-residence, **Wafaa Bilal**, *Amreeka: The Comedy Show* was born after the 2016 election, bringing together diverse comedians with one thing in common: they love to complain. Then and since, the toxic culture and politics in “Amreeka,” as many Middle Easterners pronounce it, offers ample fodder for complaints. This cathartic and witty venting holds a mirror up to realities showing they’ve become so absurd and surreal one must laugh, if not cry.


  For Iraqi artist Wafaa Bilal, the show, just like his solo works, “is an artistic platform for creating dialogue and bringing people together on highly charged topics. Not politicizing laughter but laughing at politics as a form of solidarity and resistance.”

    - name: Eman El-Husseini
      bio: A Canadian, a Palestinian, a Muslim, and a lesbian walk into a bar … it’s
        just Eman El-Husseini. Yes, she’s all those catastrophic identities
        rolled into one — her life is a current event. From the Muslim ban to
        Palestinian rights and marriage equality to the ice cream truck that
        insists on parking in front of her building, it’s all happening and it’s
        happening to her, especially. Strap in and get comfortable, Eman has a
        lot to work through. In her decade-long comedy career, Eman has
        headlined across Canada, opened for Patton Oswalt, and recorded her
        first comedy album, “Unveiled,” which can be heard regularly on SiriusXM
        Radio. She currently lives in New York City, legally, thank you very
        much.

Iraqi-born artist **Wafaa Bilal** is known internationally for his on-line performative and interactive works provoking dialogue about international and interpersonal politics. Bilal’s work explores tensions between the cultural spaces he occupies —his home in the comfort zone of the U.S. and his consciousness in the conflict zone in Iraq. For his 2007 installation, *[Domestic Tension](https://wafaabilal.com/domestic-tension/)*, Bilal spent a month in FlatFile Galleries where people could shoot him via a remote-access paintball gun. The Chicago Tribune called it “one of the sharpest works of political art to be seen in a long time”—naming him 2008 Artist of the Year. That year, City Lights published [Shoot an Iraqi: Art, Life and Resistance Under the Gun](https://wafaabilal.com/shoot-an-iraqi/) about Bilal’s life and *Domestic Tension*. Using his own body as a medium, Bilal continued to challenge the public’s comfort zone with projects like *[3rdi](https://wafaabilal.com/thirdi/)* and *[and Counting…](https://wafaabilal.com/and-counting/)*. Bilal’s work, *[Canto III](https://wafaabilal.com/canto-iii/)*, was included as part of the Iranian pavilion at the 2015 Venice Biennale. Bilal’s current work *[168:01](https://wafaabilal.com/168h01s/)* brings awareness to cultural destruction and promotes the collective healing process through education and audience participation. His work can be found in the permanent collections of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles, CA; Museum of Contemporary Photography, Chicago, IL; MATHAF: Arab Museum of Modern Art, Doha, Qatar; amongst others. He holds a BFA from the University of New Mexico, an MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and was conferred an honorary PhD from DePauw University. Bilal is currently an Arts Professor at [NYU](https://tisch.nyu.edu/about/directory/photo/112869977)'s Tisch School of the Arts.
