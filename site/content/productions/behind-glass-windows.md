description: >-
  Everyone thought the strangest thing Behrooz had ever done was to fall in love
  with a mannequin. But that was just the beginning! Adapted from *The Doll
  Behind the Curtain* by Sadegh Hedayat, *Behind Glass Windows* is a shattering
  love story that questions our perception of love and reality.


  The overpowering presence of self-inflicted exile dominates Hedayat's writing. The protagonist in *The Doll Behind the Curtain*, much like Hedayat himself feels isolated from his society. The protagonist reacts by creating an alternative reality. This contemporary stage adaptation focuses on the illusory nature of love and relationships from the perspective of second generation Iranians growing up with dual traditions. Divided between the culture of their society and that of their home, they yearn for the comfort of the familiar while seeking the excitement of the new. Within this context, the play explores the true meaning of love, freedom, and independence.

      bio: "Born to an aristocratic family in 1903 in Iran, Hedayat was among those
        distinguished students sent to Europe by Reza Shah to earn an education
        with the expectation that they would facilitate the nation's progress
        towards modernization. Upon his return, Hedayat refused to pursue his
        study of the sciences and began to study literature. His first
        collection of short stories, *Zendeh be-gur* was published in Tehran in
        1930. Soon there after Hedayat co-instituted the Rab'a (The Foursome) a
        group consisting of young returnees whose progressive ideas antagonized
        both the literati and the government. The group met in a cafe called
        Zhaleh and discussed affairs of government, the future of Iran and the
        role of Islam in it. *Sayeh Roshan*, the collection of short stories
        that includes *The Doll Behind the Curtain,*  was published in 1933 and
        is focused on issues surrounding modernization. In 1936 Reza Shah
        outlawed the Rab'a and incarcerated some of its members. Hedayat left
        for India where his thoughts on his masterpiece *The Blind Owl*
        crystallized.  After his return to Iran, Hedayat published another
        collection of short stories, *The Stray Dog*. While alienation is the
        predominant theme in this collection, a number of stories are concerned
        with issues of political consciousness and sharply criticize the Iran of
        early 1940s. In 1947, Hedayat wrote *The Pearl Cannon*, where he
        criticizes the meddling of superpowers in the affairs of smaller nations
        like Iran, at the same time condemning the Iranian government for
        allowing its people to suffer. Hedayat's last published work, *The
        Message of Kafka*, bespeaks melancholy and desperation. Crystallized in
        his work is an overwhelming sense of oppression, lack of trust and
        denial of freedom of choice. Hedayat committed suicide in 1951, in
        Paris. - \"Hedayat, S. *The Pearl Cannon*, edited by Iraj Bashiri,
        Lexington, KY: Mazda Publishers, 1986.\""

Behrooz, an Iranian young man raised in the United States must now settle down. Will he choose the comforts of tradition or the excitement of the new? Overpowered by the demands surrounding him, Behrooz creates an alternative reality, one in which a man can have a perfectly normal and emotionally satisfying relationship with a mannequin.
