          "Despite our efforts this year with the [Season for Palestine](https://goldenthread.org/season/), we continue to feel that what we are doing is not enough in the face of what's happening to our people,” states Executive Artistic Director [Sahar Assaf](https://goldenthread.org/about/people/#open-modal-Sahar%20Assaf). “We are adding this extra program—**24 Hours for Palestine: A Moon Will Rise From Darkness**—to our season to further mobilize and encourage artists to use their platforms to speak out against genocide and colonization. It is bewildering how many artists, especially in the U.S., remain silent despite the fact that the U.S. is actively complicit in this atrocity."

We come together, from North America to the Middle East and across the world, to speak out against genocide, forced displacement, cultural erasure, the murder of civilians, and the systematic silencing of Palestinian voices, narratives and heritage. We call for an immediate and permanent end to Israel’s genocidal military campaign against the Palestinian people, funded by U.S. tax dollars. We call for an end to Israel's apartheid system and its illegal occupation of Palestine. We call for the complete and unequivocal liberation of the Palestinian people, including the right of return. And we call on our global theatre community to stand with us, and to speak out with us, against genocide and for justice and liberation. We call on you to stand on the right side of history. Join us. \
