intro: >
  Our 2024 Season for Palestine is a celebration of the talent, creativity, strength, and resilience that define the Palestinian people. As we witness the unimaginable atrocities and ongoing human rights violations Palestinians are enduring, we recognize our responsibility to combat this brutal injustice by uplifting and honoring their narratives. Join us as we embark on a season of active dialogue and communal space sparked by inspiring legacy artists, award-winning plays and playwrights, emerging new works, and exciting collaborations.
