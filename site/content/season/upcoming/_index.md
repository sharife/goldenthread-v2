title: "2025 Season: Threads of Solidarity"
currentseason: "2025"
intro: Golden Thread’s 2025 Season aims to illuminate the interconnectedness of
  our struggles amplifying Palestinian, Armenian, and Afghan stories. It is our
  duty — both as artists and as global citizens — to learn from our histories,
  to tell our stories, and to pass our narratives on to future generations.
  Through a diverse collection of personal and historical narratives, this
  season, we honor the strength of those who have endured, who are still
  fighting, and the voices that refuse to be silenced. Featuring bold
  world-premiere works by women-identifying artists and fostering both local and
  national collaborations, this season invites you to join us in community and
  solidarity.
