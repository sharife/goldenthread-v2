title: "2025 Season: Threads of Solidarity"
currentseason: "2025"
intro: Golden Thread’s 2025 Season aims to illuminate the interconnectedness of
  our struggles. It is our duty — both as artists and as global citizens — to
  learn from our histories, to tell our stories, and to pass our narratives on
  to future generations. Through a diverse collection of personal and historical
  narratives, this season, we honor the strength of those who have endured, who
  are still fighting, and the voices that refuse to be silenced. Featuring local
  and national collaborations, this season invites you to join us in community
  and solidarity.
