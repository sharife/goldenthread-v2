      - title: Nasrudin's Magnificent Journey to Samarkand RETURNS!
        text: Adapted from several folk tales from the Middle East and Central Asia,
          this performance is centered around the comedic personage, Mulla
          Nasrudin or Nasrudin Hoja, a renowned wise fool. Nasrudin’s clever
          wisdom and propensity for exposing hypocrisy frequently get him into
          trouble. In this performance, we follow Nasrudin’s adventures as he
          travels through caravansaries in Konya, Damascus, and Isfahan before
          he arrives at his destination on the ancient Silk Route. Will Nasrudin
          and his faithful donkey ever make it to Samarkand, the center of arts
          and crafts on the ancient Silk Road? There is only one way to find
          out!
