      - title: Nasrudin's Magnificent Journey to Samarkand
        text: Adapted from several folk tales from the Middle East and Central Asia,
          this performance is centered around the comedic personage, Mulla
          Nasrudin or Nasrudin Hoja, a renowned wise fool. Nasrudin’s clever
          wisdom and propensity for exposing hypocrisy frequently get him into
          trouble. In this performance, we follow Nasrudin’s adventures as he
          travels through caravansaries in Konya, Damascus, and Isfahan before
          he arrives at his destination on the ancient Silk Route. Will Nasrudin
          and his faithful donkey ever make it to Samarkand, the center of arts
          and crafts on the ancient Silk Road? There is only one way to find
          out!

      - title: "Amreeka: The Comedy Show"
        subtitle: Featuring **Amer Zahr** and **Eman El-Husseini**
        pre: Friday, May 12, 2023
        text: >-
          Curated by Artist-in-residence, **Wafaa Bilal**, ***Amreeka: The
          Comedy Show*** was born after the 2016 election, bringing together
          diverse comedians with one thing in common: they love to complain.
          Then and since, the toxic culture and politics in “Amreeka,” as many
          Middle Easterners pronounce it, offers ample fodder for complaints.
          This cathartic and witty venting holds a mirror up to realities
          showing they’ve become so absurd and surreal one must laugh, if not
          cry.   


          For Iraqi artist Wafaa Bilal, the show, just like his solo works, “is an artistic platform for creating dialogue and bringing people together on highly charged topics. Not politicizing laughter but laughing at politics as a form of solidarity and resistance.”
