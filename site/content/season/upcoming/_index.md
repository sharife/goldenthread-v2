title: "2025 Season: Threads of Solidarity"
currentseason: "2025"
intro: >-
  Golden Thread’s 2025 Season aims to illuminate the interconnectedness of our
  struggles. It is our duty — both as artists and as global citizens — to learn
  from our histories, to tell our stories, and to pass our narratives on to
  future generations. Through a diverse collection of personal and historical
  narratives, this season, we honor the strength of those who have endured, who
  are still fighting, and the voices that refuse to be silenced. Featuring local
  and national collaborations, this season invites you to join us in community
  and solidarity.


  "In the face of brutal genocide, war, and rise of fascism, what can we do as individuals, as artists, as citizens of this world? Though all our efforts might seem futile, we cannot allow ourselves to fall into despair. It is simply not an option when our communities, even while under the threat of bombs, are showing such powerful resilience. So, what do we do? We continue to rebuild our lives, our homes, our humanity, one story at a time."  

  —Executive Artistic Director Sahar Assaf
