title: "2025 Season: Threads of Solidarity"
currentseason: "2025"
intro: Golden Thread’s 2025 Season aims to illuminate the interconnectedness of
  our struggles, amplifying Palestinian, Armenian, Afghan, and Turkish voices.
  This season, we honor the strength of those who have endured, who are still
  fighting, and the voices that refuse to be silenced – here in the U.S. and
  abroad. Featuring bold world-premiere works by women-identifying artists and
  fostering both local and national collaborations, this season invites you to
  join us in community to continue to build solidarity and resilience together.
