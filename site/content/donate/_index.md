# <center>Building Forward</center>

2022 was a special year filled with surprising and rare stories from new, emerging, and established artists. With your support, we leapt enthusiastically into Golden Thread’s new era and achieved many heights!

### **<center>The New Ear has Begun<center>**

We returned to full, in-person programming, after our first-ever leadership transition, with Executive Artistic Director Sahar Assaf’s incredible first season.

### **<center>**A Season of Firsts**<center>**

We produced Adam Ashraf Elsayigh’s very first play, which featured our new Executive Artistic Director Sahar Assaf’s directorial debut at Golden Thread, and introduced celebrated Iranian playwright Naghmeh Samini in her U.S. premiere. We commissioned a new play and helped develop the work of artists exploring home, traveling on epic journeys, and searching to find their true selves.

### **<center>**So Many Rare Gems**<center>**

We uplifted a rare queer MENA narrative about an important historical event in Adam Ashraf Elsayigh’s *Drowning in Cairo*, a contemporary Iranian story about love and marriage with a surprising twist in Naghmeh Samini’s *The Language of Wild Berries*, and the beloved tale of Nasrudin’s mischief and morality from the Muslim world written by Torange Yeghiazarian, directed by Sarah Al Kassab.

### **<center>**We Went on the Road**<center>**

The *Golden Thread Fairytale Players* returned to Bay Area schools and libraries, our *New Threads Staged Reading Series* traveled to Brava Theater, ZSpace, and the Potrero Stage, and Adam Ashraf Elsayigh’s *Drowning in Cairo* went all the way to The Lab at Georgetown University in Washington DC.

### **<center>**More Screen Time**<center>**

We livestreamed our *What Do the Women Say?* program with virtual and in-person artists and audiences, offered a Video-on-demand version of both mainstage productions, and our digital *No Summary* artist conversation series appeared on Facebook, Howlround.tv and as part of the 2022 MENATMA (MENA Theater Makers Alliance) Convening
