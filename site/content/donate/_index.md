**2026 marks Golden Thread’s 30th anniversary**, and we're marking this impressive milestone with an audacious Golden30 Campaign to raise $300,000 over the next 12 months! Our first goal is to raise $30,000 by the end of 2025. **[Will you join us in securing the next 30 years for Golden Thread?](https://goldenthread.my.salesforce-sites.com/donate/?dfId=a0n3Z00000tn4RsQAI)**

**For the last 30 years, Golden Thread has stood strong as the first American theater company dedicated to the Middle East.** As the world has witnessed the rise of Islamophobia after 9/11, the devastation of the war on Iraq, and now the ongoing genocide in Palestine, we have remained steadfast with our unwavering, multicultural voice for Middle Eastern and North African communities. **Our stories defy stereotypes and challenge false narratives with rich humanity.**

As we reflect on our legacy, we are overwhelmed by the number of artists, supporters, and champions like you who made our success possible. In 30 years, we have:

* **Produced more than 150 plays**, most of them world premieres;
* **Employed over 2,000 artists**, majority of whom are women, queer, BIPOC, or of Middle Eastern heritage;
* **Served more than 80,000 audience members**
* **Partnered with more than 150 organizations** at the front lines of the fight for justice 

**No one does what Golden Thread does, and our communities need us now more than ever.** As funding from the government and foundations dwindle, and censorship and authoritarianism become commonplace, we launch the Golden30 Campaign with a clear commitment: to **build a strong foundation for growth and stability, ensuring that our essential cultural home for many communities continues to thrive.**

We invite you to join us in securing the next 30 years of Golden Thread’s vibrant future. **[Can we count on your donation in 2025 to help us reach our first $30,000 milestone?](https://goldenthread.my.salesforce-sites.com/donate/?dfId=a0n3Z00000tn4RsQAI)**
