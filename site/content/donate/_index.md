# <center>A New Era of Golden Thread Begins with You!</center>

The future of Golden Thread is full of possibility as we devise new opportunities, explore fresh ideas, practice artistic invention, and build new connections. As we embark together on Golden Thread’s next chapter, we are excited and inspired to carry on the legacy of our history and mission.  We remain:

**Committed to Artistic Excellence**

* We make daring artistic choices, take risks, and experiment in the pursuit of high quality productions that build community and cultural empowerment.

  * Oh My Sweet Land, Scenes From 71* Years, The Language of Wild Berries, Drowning in Cairo
* We commission new works, facilitating innovative collaborations and initiating unique development processes with a long track record of producing world premieres and collaboratively developing original plays.

  * Benedictus, Ecstasy | a waterfable, Night Over Erzinga, Isfahan Blues, We Swim, We Talk, We Go to War
* We are a vibrant artistic home to artists at various stages of their career and have helped launch the careers of nationally recognized playwrights.

  * Yussef el Guindi, Betty Shamieh, Denmo Ibrahim, Mona Mansour, Adriana Sevahn Nichols
* We are a pioneer in the field of Middle Eastern American theatre, establishing exceptional signature programs unparalleled in the national theatre scene.

  * ReOrient Festival, Fairytale Players, What Do the Women Say?

**<center>Leading the Charge on Equity<center>**

Building on years of advocating for artists of Middle Eastern heritage, we co-authored two seminal documents released in 2017. The Middle Eastern American Theatre Artists Bill of Rights and the Dear Producers letter were early examples of calls for more equitable practices in the American theater and have since served as models of change among theatre producers.

**<center>Championing Community<center>**

We are the first American theatre to focus on the Middle East, with a founder widely recognized as “the Mother of Middle Eastern American Theatre.” We are also a proud founding member of the newly launched Middle Eastern North African Theatre Makers Alliance, the first national organization advocating for our community.

**<center>Diversity is Our Core<center>**

Our audience is unlike any other. Over half of our audience self-identify as Middle Eastern, and there are 12 languages spoken amongst them. More than 70% of our artists are from BIPOC and immigrant communities, with many also identifying as mixed blood and/or LGBTQ. Golden Thread is that rare artistic home where everyone is encouraged to bring their full self and the many layers of their identity to the table. 

**<center>Innovation is Our Practice<center>**

We continuously innovate and make space for artistic risk taking. Back in 2009 we staged The Review, written to be performed over Skype with one actor, director, and audience team in San Francisco, and one team in Cairo. In 2012, we launched Project Alo?, a video dialogue project produced on participants smart phones, that partnered Middle Eastern American artists with artists in the Middle East. And today, we are producing audio plays and connecting with our global audience through new digital content.

**<center>Instilling Cultural Pride<center>**

Our ground-breaking programs like Golden Thread Fairytale Players and Islam 101 bring timeless tales and historical figures to life with dazzling visuals, dance, and music, providing Middle Eastern youth and families the rare opportunity to celebrate their heritage across generations and communities.
