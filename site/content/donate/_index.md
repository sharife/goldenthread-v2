A﻿s the U.S. Government ramps up its attack on immigrants, vilification of Middle Eastern countries and people, and a﻿ctive defunding of the Arts, we must stand together to fight back. Please consider supporting Golden Thread to make sure that our work continues to grow and thrive.

F﻿or almost 30 years as the first American theatre company devoted to the Middle East, Golden Thread has been a leader in changing the narrative on our o﻿ften-vilified region and its people. And our 2025 Season is no different!

Golden Thread’s 2025 Season aims to illuminate the interconnectedness of our struggles amplifying Palestinian, Armenian, and Afghan stories. It is our duty — both as artists and as global citizens — to learn from our histories, to tell our stories, and to pass our narratives on to future generations. Through a diverse collection of personal and historical narratives, this season, we honor the strength of those who have endured, who are still fighting, and the voices that refuse to be silenced. Featuring bold world-premiere works by women-identifying artists and fostering both local and national collaborations, this season invites you to join us in community and solidarity.
